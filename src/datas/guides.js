      <h3>Step 1: Place the Pink Bed with Bunny Ears in the Top-Right Corner</h3>

      <h3>Step 3: Add the Large Teddy Bear on the Right Side</h3>
      <p>Move the big teddy bear with a bow tie to the lower-right corner, maintaining visual balance while keeping it near the bed.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Arrange the Rocking Horse Near the Bed</h3>
      <p>Place the pink-and-white rocking horse near the foot of the bed, slightly towards the center, giving it enough space to breathe.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Set Up the Bookshelf on the Left Wall</h3>

      <h3>Step 6: Lay Down the Pink Rug in Front of the Bed</h3>
      <p>Unroll the pink rug starting at the bed’s foot toward the center of the room. This adds warmth and brings the setup together.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Hang the Cloud Decorations and Pastel Bunting</h3>
      <p>Attach the cloud wall decor to the top-left of the back wall and drape the pastel bunting across the upper part for a dreamy effect.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Mount the Bulletin Board Beside the Window</h3>
      <p>Place the bulletin board below the window on the right wall and pin a few notes to complete the cozy corner.</p>

      </ul>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>Some items may need in-game currency to unlock—plan ahead.</li>
        <li>Check for scaling options if your version allows item resizing.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Level 2 invites you to style a compact bathroom by placing furniture and fixtures in their ideal locations. Use this guide to ensure every object is perfectly arranged.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Position the Bathtub on the Center-Left</h3>
      <p>Begin by placing the bathtub slightly left of center, with its length parallel to the back wall. This setup makes room for plumbing connections and adjacent furnishings.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Install the Toilet in the Far Left Corner</h3>
      <p>Move the toilet into the bottom-left corner of the room. Keeping it near the tub helps maintain a logical and efficient bathroom layout.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Mount the Water Heater Above the Tub</h3>
      <p>Attach the water heater to the wall above the showerhead. Keep it elevated and aligned to avoid overlapping with other items.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Add the Ventilation Fan Above the Toilet</h3>
      <p>Install the fan above the toilet area to help with airflow and humidity. Center it on the left wall for a functional and symmetrical design.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Arrange the Sink and Mirror on the Right Wall</h3>
      <p>Place the sink near the right side, close to the door, and hang the mirror above it. This layout ensures practical access and visual balance.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Fit the Window with Curtains Behind the Tub</h3>
      <p>Mount the window on the back wall behind the bathtub, then add pink curtains. This touch softens the space and brings in natural light.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Decorate with Accessories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Toilet Paper & Shelf:</strong> Place a holder beside the toilet and add a small shelf with extra rolls above.</li>
        <li><strong>Bath Products:</strong> Line shampoo and soap along the bathtub’s edge.</li>
        <li><strong>Playful Touches:</strong> Position the rubber duck on the plush dog inside the tub.</li>
        <li><strong>Towel Hamper:</strong> Place a basket with towels next to the sink.</li>
        <li><strong>Plant:</strong> Set a tall bamboo plant near the sink for a fresh look.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Lay Rugs, Mats, and Slippers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bath Mat:</strong> Spread a cozy mat in front of the tub.</li>
        <li><strong>Entry Doormat & Slippers:</strong> Add them near the door to finish the space.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the preview feature to test placements before finalizing.</li>
        <li>Group related items like bottles or towels for clarity and order.</li>
        <li>Utilize wall space to free up floor area.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure large fixtures are properly aligned before placing accessories.</li>
        <li>Double-check vertical placements like the heater and fan to avoid overlap.</li>
        <li>Leave breathing space between decor to avoid clutter.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>With these steps, you’ll complete Dreamy Room Level 2 with a well-designed bathroom layout that’s both practical and inviting. Happy decorating!</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Set the “CEO” Nameplate on the Desk</h3>
      <p>Place the small “CEO” plaque at the front edge of the desk. This small detail adds to the professional atmosphere of the workspace.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Arrange the Laptop and Lamp on the Desk</h3>

      <h3>Step 5: Add the Coffee Mug in Front of the Chair</h3>
      <p>Position the coffee mug in front of the chair, slightly to the right of the laptop. This adds a cozy, lived-in feel to the workspace.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Install the Bookshelf to the Right Wall</h3>
      <p>Place the bookshelf against the right wall behind the desk. Make sure it doesn’t overlap with the air conditioner, leaving enough space between objects.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Place Books and Decorative Items on the Bookshelf</h3>
      <p>Fill the middle shelf with colorful books, and add a small decorative box on the top shelf. Keep these items neat and orderly for a clean, professional look.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Hang the Clock and Calendar on the Right Wall</h3>
      <p>Mount the round clock on the upper right wall, and hang the calendar just below it. These wall-mounted items help balance the room’s layout.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 9: Mount the Air Conditioner Above the Bookshelf</h3>
      <p>Install the air conditioner in the top corner of the right wall, above the bookshelf. Be mindful that it doesn’t block the clock or calendar.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Add Potted Plants and the Backpack</h3>
      <p>Place one potted plant with red flowers on the left corner of the desk, and a green plant on the floor in front of the desk. Position the backpack to the left side of the desk to complete the space.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 11: Lay Down the Round Rug</h3>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 4 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>In Dreamy Room Level 4, you’ll create a cozy kitchen from scratch. The main challenge is placing each object in the perfect spot. Follow these steps to complete the scene.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Place the Fridge in the Left Corner</h3>
      <p>Position the large orange refrigerator against the left wall, flush with the corner. Make sure the fridge door faces inward. You can add colorful notes or magnets to the fridge door to make it feel more cheerful.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Install the Overhead Cabinets Above the Counter</h3>
      <p>Place the yellow overhead cabinets directly to the right of the fridge along the top portion of the wall. Proper alignment of the cabinets is crucial in this step as it sets the base for the kitchen setup.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Set the Counter, Sink, and Stove Beneath the Cabinets</h3>
      <p>Position a continuous counter beneath the cabinets, leaving space for a built-in sink in the center. Place a dish-drying rack to the right of the sink. On the far right side of the counter, set a stovetop with a frying pan. Accurate placement is key in this step, as the alignment affects how other objects fit.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Add the Window and Short Green Curtain</h3>
      <p>Install a small rectangular window above the sink and place a short green curtain on it. The window should align so there’s enough wall space on the right for the utensils rack.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Hang the Utensils on the Right Wall</h3>
      <p>Hang the cooking utensils rack on the right wall, beside the window. Include items like a spatula, ladle, and frying pan or pot lid. This step adds realism to the kitchen and maximizes the use of available wall space.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Position the Table and Tablecloth in the Center</h3>
      <p>Place a rectangular table with a white or cream-colored tablecloth in the center of the room. Ensure there is enough space on all sides of the table for easy movement and interaction.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Arrange the Bowls and Serving Dishes on the Table</h3>
      <p>On top of the table, place several bowls, a large serving dish, and any additional tableware. This step completes the cooking and dining theme of the level.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Include the Bunny Character (Optional Decoration)</h3>
      <p>Add the pink bunny character or plush in front of the table, holding a spatula. While not required for completion, it brings the room to life and adds a whimsical touch.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 9: Place the Rice Cooker (or Teapot) and Plant on the Right Side</h3>
      <p>Position a small counter or stand next to the stove area and place a rice cooker or teapot on top. Add a potted plant beside or below it, close to the window, to enhance the natural décor.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Final Touches: Rugs, Floor Mats, and Tiny Details</h3>
      <p>Place a small rug or mat in front of the sink to match the color scheme. Optionally, add a second mat near the entrance. Carefully double-check each item’s placement to ensure everything is perfectly aligned for a flawless finish.</p>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Preview the layout before finalizing placement to ensure everything fits properly.</li>
        <li>Rotate items when necessary to improve alignment in tight spaces.</li>
        <li>Utilize the grid or snapping feature in the game to avoid uneven gaps between objects.</li>
        <li>Decorate in layers—start with large items like the fridge and cabinets, and finish with smaller décor for a smooth experience.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure precise alignment, particularly with the sink and stove, to avoid blocking space for other objects.</li>
        <li>Avoid overlapping objects like the fridge and cabinets as this can disrupt the placement process.</li>
        <li>Install cabinets before adding the counter and sink to maintain proper alignment.</li>
        <li>Save your progress frequently to avoid losing your layout.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following this detailed walkthrough, you’ll successfully design a cozy, well-organized kitchen. Take your time, and enjoy transforming the empty room into a warm cooking space filled with charm!</p>
