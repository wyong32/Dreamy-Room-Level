    detailsHtml: `<h2>The Design Philosophy Behind Dreamy Room</h2>
      <p>When we first set out to create Dreamy Room Level, we wanted to build more than just another puzzle game. We envisioned a space where players could express their creativity while enjoying satisfying challenges and a sense of accomplishment. Today, I'd like to share the core design principles that guide our development process.</p>

      <h3>Balance Between Structure and Freedom</h3>
      <p>At the heart of Dreamy Room is the delicate balance between structured puzzles and creative freedom. Each level has specific goals to achieve, but we always ensure multiple ways to solve them. This approach allows players to express their unique style while still providing the satisfaction of overcoming challenges.</p>

      <h3>Visual Harmony</h3>
      <p>Our art style aims to create a sense of visual harmony that's both appealing and functional. We use a carefully selected color palette that evokes warmth and comfort, with special attention to how colors interact when players combine different elements. The slightly stylized, not-quite-realistic approach helps create a dreamy atmosphere while keeping the interface clean and readable.</p>

      <h3>Progressive Complexity</h3>
      <p>We believe in gradually introducing complexity to keep players engaged without overwhelming them. Early levels focus on basic concepts, while later levels combine multiple mechanics in interesting ways. This progression creates a learning curve that feels rewarding rather than frustrating.</p>

      <h3>Emotional Resonance</h3>
      <p>Perhaps most importantly, we design with emotional resonance in mind. We want players to feel a connection to the spaces they create. This guides everything from the narrative elements we include to the small details in animations when objects interact. The satisfaction of creating a beautiful, harmonious space is at the core of the Dreamy Room experience.</p>

      <h3>Accessibility and Inclusivity</h3>
      <p>We strive to make Dreamy Room accessible to players of all backgrounds and abilities. This includes customizable controls, colorblind-friendly design options, and culturally diverse decoration themes. We believe everyone should be able to enjoy the creative experience our game offers.</p>

      <p>These principles continue to guide us as we develop new content and features. We're always learning from our community and refining our approach to create the best possible experience. Thank you for being part of this journey with us!</p>`,

    detailsHtml: `<h2>Community Spotlight: Amazing Room Designs</h2>
      <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of working on Dreamy Room Level is seeing the incredible creations our community shares. Today, we're spotlighting some exceptional designs that showcase the creativity and ingenuity of our players.</p>

      <h3>Minimalist Zen Garden by @dreamdesigner</h3>
      <p>This stunning Japanese-inspired room uses a restrained color palette and careful placement to create a sense of peace and tranquility. The designer explained that they wanted to create a space that felt like "a deep breath in digital form." The clever use of levels and lighting creates depth in what could otherwise be a flat space.</p>

      <h3>Whimsical Bookshop by @readingnook</h3>
      <p>This charming design transforms a standard room into a cozy bookshop complete with reading nooks and hidden details. What makes this design special is the storytelling element—each section of the bookshop represents a different literary genre, with tiny easter eggs for book lovers to discover.</p>

      <h3>Futuristic Apartment by @tomorrowtoday</h3>
      <p>Pushing the boundaries of the game's decoration system, this design creates a convincing sci-fi living space that feels both futuristic and livable. The designer used clever color combinations to create the illusion of holographic elements and ambient lighting that wasn't actually available in the game—truly thinking outside the box!</p>

      <h3>Seasonal Transformation by @weatherwizard</h3>
      <p>This innovative design showcases the same room across all four seasons, with clever transitions between each section. The attention to detail is remarkable, with subtle changes in lighting, color temperature, and decorative elements that tell the story of a year passing in one unified design.</p>

      <h3>Optical Illusion Room by @perspectivepro</h3>
      <p>Perhaps the most technically impressive design in our spotlight, this room plays with perspective and optical illusions to create spaces that seem impossible. Using forced perspective techniques and careful color blocking, the designer created areas that appear to extend beyond the room's actual boundaries.</p>

      <h3>Get Featured</h3>
      <p>Want to see your design in a future community spotlight? Share your creations on social media with the hashtag #DreamyRoomDesign or post them in our official Discord channel. We're always looking for innovative designs to feature!</p>
