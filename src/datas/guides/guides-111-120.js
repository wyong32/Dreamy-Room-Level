        "detailsHtml": `<h2>Dreamy Room Level 111 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
            <p>Dreamy Room Level 111 centers around transforming an empty room into a lively factory loft with two distinct levels and multiple work zones. Precision placement is key to successfully completing this design-focused level. Follow these steps to ensure everything snaps into place perfectly.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 1: Place the sliding door on the left wall</h3>
            <p>Begin by positioning the sliding door on the left wall panel, aligning its bottom edge with the floor and its frame within the rectangular recess. This is the foundation for your design, so proper grid alignment is critical. Ensure the door snaps cleanly into place before moving on.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 2: Assemble the elevated walkway and conveyor crates</h3>
            <p>Next, assemble the central elevated walkway. Place the L-shaped platform segment one tile above the floor against the back wall. Attach the straight connector piece to extend it to the right, creating a T-shaped catwalk. Afterward, place four sky-blue crates at even intervals on the walkway, making sure they snap into the conveyor rails.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 3: Set up the delivery van and green bunny worker</h3>
            <p>On the lower-left grid tile, place the white-and-blue delivery van right next to the sliding door. Ensure its wheels align with the floor seams. Then, place the green bunny worker on the van’s rear platform, with its front paws resting on the rear crate. Look for the highlight indicator that confirms a correct drop.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 4: Place the robotic assembly arms and the central bunny mech</h3>
            <p>Focus on the central assembly node. Select the pair of robotic arm pieces and anchor each base onto the white mounting blocks on the floor grid. Swivel the joints outward to create a symmetrical V-shape. Place the larger green bunny mech body precisely between the two arms, making sure its limbs align with their gripping claws.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 5: Arrange the packing station and secondary bunny packer</h3>
            <p>Set up the packing station on the right side of the assembly area. Place the blue table module on the right-side grid and ensure its legs are flush with the floor. Put the cyan basket on the right side of the table. Position the green bunny packer figure in front of the basket, then mount the small wall console with its glowing screen above the table.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 6: Install the glass control booth and manager's desk</h3>
            <p>For the grand finale, install the transparent glass control booth atop the elevated walkway. Snap its four corner pillars into the platform’s sockets. Next, place the blue desk piece in the center against the booth's back wall. Arrange the computer monitors on the desk, with the large central screen flanked by two smaller ones. Finally, add the coffee cup, printer, wastebasket, and the bespectacled bunny supervisor in the swivel chair.</p>
      
            <h2>Tips for Dreamy Room Level 111</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Activate the grid snap:</strong> This feature helps you see faint outlines before dropping objects, ensuring perfect alignment.</li>
              <li><strong>Start with large pieces:</strong> Placing the sliding door and elevated walkway first anchors your layout and makes subsequent placements easier.</li>
              <li><strong>Check for the glow:</strong> Correctly placed items will often glow or snap with a satisfying sound. If an item jitters or won't snap, it's likely misaligned.</li>
            </ul>
      
            <h2>Walkthrough Strategy</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Layout the foundation:</strong> Secure the door and walkway before adding any other items.</li>
              <li><strong>Build work zones:</strong> Create the delivery, assembly, and packing stations one by one.</li>
              <li><strong>Add characters and details last:</strong> Place the bunny workers, manager, and other small accessories to bring the scene to life.</li>
            </ul>
      
            <p>Following this Dreamy Room Level 111 solution walkthrough will help you build a charming factory loft with perfect symmetry and an efficient layout.</p>`

            <p>Dreamy Room Level 112 challenges you to transform a blank stone chamber into a captivating treasure vault filled with secrets and adventure. Precision placement is key to successfully completing this design-focused level. Follow these steps to ensure everything snaps into place perfectly.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 1: Place the vault door, gear panel, and lever</h3>
            <p>Begin by placing the large, circular vault door on the left wall, centering it horizontally just above the floor. Next, position the small gear control panel to the right of the vault door, followed by the red-handled lever. Ensure the panel and lever are slightly separated to avoid any collision.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 2: Place the weapon stand with axe and musket</h3>
            <p>Position the purple weapon stand under the metal railing on the left wall. Place the double-headed axe in the left notch and the musket in the right notch. Make sure both weapons are nestled snugly without overlapping the railing or floor.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 3: Decorate the walls with various items</h3>
            <p>Mount the deer head trophy above the wooden shelf, centering the antlers between the vault door and the corner support. Install the wooden cabinet below the trophy. Hang the gold-framed mirror to the right of the shelf, and then place the ornate lantern sconce next to the mirror. Finally, fit the arched wooden door over the curved right wall opening and place three wooden pegs beneath it.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 4: Arrange the statue and cushioned chest under the staircase</h3>
            <p>In the alcove under the staircase, place the draped statue with a glowing purple orb on the tall column at the back. Slide it inward slightly so the orb is visible. Position the purple-cushioned chest directly beneath the stairs, tucking it against the curved wall for a snug fit. Adjust both items to avoid overlap with the stairs.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 5: Curate the central jewelry display</h3>
            <p>Center the long wooden display table in the middle of the room. Drape the red runner cloth over its surface. Place the golden jewelry bust in the center of the table, draping a pearl necklace over its shoulders. Arrange the sapphire-blue diamond gem to the right of the bust, and two leather-bound scroll cases and a rustic mug to the left. Lean three rolled rugs against the back of the table and place a wooden barrel adjacent to its right corner.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 6: Fill the floor with treasure chests and study items</h3>
            <p>In the bottom-left corner, set an open treasure chest spilling gold coins next to a closed one. Position a burlap sack of coins and a separate pile of scattered gold with an ornate sword laid across it. Stack three barrels to the right of the coin pile. In the right alcove, arrange the round wooden side table, laying out an open book, three stacked tomes, a quill, a mug, and a golden key. Finally, place the rocking chair facing the table for a cozy touch.</p>
      
            <h2>Tips for Dreamy Room Level 112</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Use the grid overlay:</strong> Toggle the grid overlay to gain precision when aligning items.</li>
              <li><strong>Avoid overlaps:</strong> Be careful not to overlap items with fixed elements like stairs or railings, as this can cause placement issues.</li>
              <li><strong>Nudge for perfection:</strong> Since object rotation is preset, use subtle nudges with the arrow keys to achieve perfect placement.</li>
            </ul>
      
            <h2>Walkthrough Strategy</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Start with the walls:</strong> Placing the vault door and other wall decor first establishes the room’s main structure.</li>
              <li><strong>Build the central display:</strong> Curating the jewelry table early on creates a focal point for the rest of the room.</li>
              <li><strong>Fill the floor last:</strong> Use treasure chests, barrels, and study items to fill the remaining space and add character to the scene.</li>
            </ul>
      
            <p>Following this Dreamy Room Level 112 solution walkthrough will help you build a mysterious and luxurious treasure vault with perfect symmetry and an adventurous narrative.</p>`

          <p>Dreamy Room Level 113 invites you to transform a plain stone chamber into an <strong>enchanted indoor garden</strong> filled with glowing flora, sparkling crystals, and mystical fountains. Careful placement of natural and magical elements is the key to success in this level.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 1: Place the central fountain</h3>
          <p>Start by positioning the circular stone fountain in the middle of the room. Ensure the water spouts face upward and the glowing lilies are visible around the rim. This will serve as the garden’s centerpiece.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 2: Arrange glowing plants and vines</h3>
          <p>Attach glowing ivy vines along the left and right walls, making sure they drape naturally without covering the fountain. Place two potted glowing mushrooms on either side of the fountain for balance. Position the tall crystal-flower plant near the left corner.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 3: Add magical crystals and artifacts</h3>
          <p>Cluster three radiant crystals in the back alcove, ensuring their glow illuminates the surrounding plants. Place a small stone pedestal near the crystals and set a magical orb on top. To the right wall, hang a rune-carved plaque to add arcane flair.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 4: Create the seating nook</h3>
          <p>In the lower-right corner, place the wooden bench with vine carvings. Add a soft green cushion on the bench. Position a round side table next to it, placing a glowing book, a tea mug, and a small lantern on its surface for a cozy touch.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 5: Add floor details and finishing touches</h3>
          <p>Scatter a few stepping stones leading from the doorway to the fountain. Place a basket of herbs and a watering can near the bench. Finally, arrange two luminous butterflies above the fountain for a magical finishing detail.</p>
      
          <h2>Tips for Dreamy Room Level 113</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Balance natural and magical elements:</strong> Don’t overcrowd one side of the room with glowing objects—spread them evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Use symmetry:</strong> The fountain serves as the center; align items symmetrically for a pleasing look.</li>
            <li><strong>Mind visibility:</strong> Make sure glowing plants and crystals are not hidden behind walls or furniture.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h2>Walkthrough Strategy</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with the centerpiece:</strong> The fountain should be placed first to guide all other arrangements.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer natural décor:</strong> Add vines and plants before artifacts to ensure proper layering.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalize the nook:</strong> The seating corner gives the room a lived-in, enchanting feel—decorate it thoughtfully.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Level 114 turns a bare stone room into a <strong>Celestial Observatory</strong>. Precision matters: align optical devices with the star dome, maintain walkway clearance, and keep the scholarly corner tidy for an elegant, functional layout.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 1: Install the rotating star dome</h3>
          <p>Mount the segmented <em>star dome</em> across the ceiling. Center the main circular aperture over the room’s midpoint so projected constellations land symmetrically on the walls. Nudge until the dome ribs align with the room’s corner pillars.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 2: Anchor the brass telescope and tripod</h3>
          <p>Place the <strong>brass telescope</strong> on its tripod near the front-right quadrant, aimed toward the dome’s aperture. Ensure the eyepiece clears the railing and that the tripod legs don’t clip the floor trim. Add the adjustment wheel panel to the right side of the mount.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 3: Set the orrery and instrument pedestal</h3>
          <p>Position the <strong>orrery</strong> (miniature solar system) on a waist-high pedestal left of center, leaving walking space between it and the telescope. Rotate it so the largest ring faces outward. Place the small <em>instrument tray</em> beside it with calipers, a sextant, and a pocket watch.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 4: Hang constellation charts and wall plaques</h3>
          <p>On the back wall, hang the three <strong>constellation charts</strong> in a horizontal line: Northern, Equatorial, Southern. Keep equal spacing and align their bottom edges. Add two brass <em>star plaques</em> above the side arches for visual balance, and a crescent-moon sconce between the charts.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 5: Build the scholar’s desk nook</h3>
          <p>In the lower-left corner, place the <strong>oak desk</strong> facing inward. Add a leather chair slightly angled toward the telescope. On the desk, arrange an open atlas, quill & inkwell, rolled ephemerides (two stacked, one tied), and a dim desk lamp. Slide a narrow bookshelf behind the chair with logbooks and a boxed lens kit.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 6: Floor markers, ladder, and finishing details</h3>
          <p>Lay a circular <em>compass rug</em> beneath the dome center. Place the collapsible <strong>ladder</strong> near the back-right pillar to suggest access for dome maintenance. Scatter three star stones along the rug’s perimeter and place a covered crate of spare lenses near the doorway without blocking the path.</p>
      
          <h2>Tips for Dreamy Room Level 114</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mind sightlines:</strong> Keep the telescope’s beam path clear of shelves and sconces.</li>
            <li><strong>Symmetry matters:</strong> Charts and plaques should mirror the dome ribs for a clean look.</li>
            <li><strong>Leave walk space:</strong> Maintain a clear corridor between the orrery and the desk nook.</li>
            <li><strong>Use gentle nudges:</strong> Micro-adjust with arrow keys for perfect edge alignment.</li>

        <h2>Dreamy Room Level 115 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
          <p>Level 115 transforms a bare space into a secure and polished <strong>Finance Office</strong>. In this walkthrough, precision is everything—align cameras, monitors, teller desks, and ATMs to create an efficient, professional environment.</p>
            <img src="/images/guides_115_1.webp" alt="Level 115 of the Dreamy Room game" />
          <h3>Step 1: Place the two CCTV cameras</h3>
          <p>Mount the <strong>CCTV cameras</strong> on the upper left and right corners. Angle each at 45 degrees to cover the entire floor. Ensure their lenses overlap slightly without creating blind spots, securing full surveillance coverage.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 2: Install the electronic monitors</h3>
          <p>On the left wall, place three <strong>electronic monitors</strong>—currency rate display, buy/sell tracker, and trend graph—at eye level. Align their top edges and maintain equal spacing for a clean presentation.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 3: Arrange bill counter, safe, and cash</h3>
          <p>On the left storage cabinet, place the <em>bill counter</em> to the far left, the <strong>circular safe</strong> beside it, and stacks of <em>cash bundles</em> and money bags to the right. Keep spacing consistent for visual balance.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 4: Add potted plants</h3>
          <p>Bring life to the office with greenery. Place a <strong>white planter</strong> by the teller desk, a tall leafy plant near the ATMs, and a <em>flower vase</em> on the side table by the sofa. These soften the banking setup.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 5: Set up the teller desk</h3>
          <p>Center the curved <strong>teller desk</strong> at the foreground, facing inward. Add two <em>barstool chairs</em> in front, evenly spaced. Mount the <strong>plexiglass barrier</strong> on the desk between the monitors for realism.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 6: Install rope barrier</h3>
          <p>Place two polished posts in front of the teller desk and connect them with a <em>red velvet rope</em>. Align them evenly with the desk edges to guide visitor flow.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 7: Position the ATMs</h3>
          <p>Place two <strong>ATM machines</strong> against the back wall. Align their bases with the floor grid and ensure equal spacing between them for symmetry and functionality.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 8: Mount the air conditioning unit</h3>
          <p>Install the <strong>air conditioner</strong> above the monitors on the back wall. Align it centrally between the two CCTV cameras, keeping its bottom edge just above the top of the trend graph monitor.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 9: Hang world map and projector</h3>
          <p>Mount the <em>projector</em> near the ceiling, slightly right of center. Place the <strong>world map display</strong> directly below it, ensuring it sits above the ATMs without clipping into them.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 10: Install window with curtains</h3>
          <p>On the right wall, add the <strong>window</strong> below the right CCTV camera. Attach the <em>green curtains</em> so they drape naturally to floor level, enhancing the room’s realism.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 11: Arrange seating area</h3>
          <p>Create comfort in the right-front area with a <strong>sofa</strong>, <em>armchair</em>, <em>coffee table</em>, and <em>side table</em>. Place a flower vase on the side table and a mug and book on the coffee table for cozy details.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 12: Add welcome mat and kiosk</h3>
          <p>Finalize the entryway with a <strong>welcome mat</strong> in front of the teller desk and a <strong>kiosk terminal</strong> to its right. Align them with the grid for precise positioning.</p>
      
          <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Use snap-to-grid guides to prevent misalignments.</li>
            <li>Avoid overlapping items, especially with the ATMs and rope barriers.</li>
            <li>Check boundary edges so no object clips off-screen.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Lock major pieces first (desks, ATMs, windows) before adjusting small décor.</li>
            <li>Use blueprint overlay mode to measure distances precisely.</li>
            <li>Work zone by zone—electronics, furniture, then decorative accents.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h2>Final Scene Description</h2>
          <p>In the completed <strong>Dreamy Room Level 115</strong>, CCTV cameras oversee a polished financial hub. Monitors glow on the left wall above a safe and bill counter, with stacks of cash carefully arranged. A teller desk with plexiglass and barstools anchors the center, while ATMs line the back wall. Potted plants and a seating area add warmth, complemented by a world map projection and a window with green curtains. A welcome mat and kiosk at the entrance complete the professional yet welcoming Finance Office.</p>`

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 116 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>Level 116 transforms a blank stage into a <strong>floating garden retreat</strong>. Every detail matters: align the water border, set the grassy base, stack columns and tree foliage, and finish with lively animals and props for a balanced, magical outcome.</p>
      <img src="/images/guides_116_1.webp" alt="Level 116 of the Dreamy Room game" />
      <h3>Step 1: Prepare the water border and grassy foundation</h3>
      <p>Select the pale sky-blue <em>frame tile</em> and snap it along the placement grid edges to form a water moat. Inside, fit the irregular green <strong>turf mat</strong> into the left section, leaving no gaps. This base defines the whole composition.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Construct the pillared platforms</h3>
      <p>Place the <strong>tallest gray column</strong> at the rear center, the medium-height cylinder just to its right, and the shortest in the far-right corner. Add the small cuboid block in front of the medium column for a staircase effect. These pillars create your vertical skyline.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Position the shell house and interior details</h3>
      <p>Install the <strong>blue shell-shaped house</strong> slightly right of center, facing forward. Inside, add the wooden balcony rail, miniature desk with scrolls and maps, and a curved sleeping alcove at the base. These touches make the dwelling feel alive.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Assemble the tree trunk and foliage cubes</h3>
      <p>Attach the <strong>brown trunk</strong> atop the tallest column. Crown it with three turf cubes—left, center, and right—for leafy platforms. Wrap vines around the trunk and let white blossoms drape naturally between cubes for organic flow.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 5: Add birds, nest, flora, and ground-level props</h3>
      <p>Perch a <strong>blue bird</strong> on the left cube and a <strong>pink bird</strong> on the right, facing inward. Place a <em>nest with three eggs</em> on the center cube. At ground level, cluster mushrooms near the right column, set stump stools before the shell house, hang a cauldron from its frame, and span the moat with a short bridge. Add palm fronds, broad leaves, lily pads, and a tiny frog for finishing charm.</p>
      
      <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Check snaps:</strong> After each placement, rotate the camera to confirm perfect fit.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid drags:</strong> Lift and re-drop large items to prevent dislodging nearby pieces.</li>
      <li><strong>Mind limits:</strong> Track prop counts to avoid hitting the placement cap mid-build.</li>
      <li><strong>Move tool first:</strong> Use the move function instead of undo to avoid erasing correct setups.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Start large:</strong> Place the moat, turf mat, and pillars first to define proportions.</li>
      <li><strong>Use auto-rotate:</strong> Quickly align symmetrical props like birds or mushrooms.</li>
      <li><strong>Group items:</strong> Keep similar pieces in quick slots for faster switching.</li>
      <li><strong>Switch views:</strong> Bird’s-eye view reveals misalignments hidden from the front.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Final Scene Description</h2>
      <p>The finished Level 116 shows a serene garden bordered by blue water. A grassy mat hosts a shell-like blue cottage with balcony and cozy interior. Behind it, three columns rise, crowned with turf cubes, vines, blossoms, and bird companions around a nest. Below, mushrooms, stumps, a cauldron, bridge, lily pads, and a frog complete the magical, balanced tableau.</p>

      <p>Level 117 transforms your scene into a <strong>riverside campsite</strong> anchored by a whimsical camera-shaped house. Follow this walkthrough to place the main structure, rooftop picnic, camper van lounge, and detailed riverside props.</p>
      <img src="/images/guides_117_1.webp" alt="Level 117 of the Dreamy Room game" />
      <h3>Step 1: Place the vintage camera structure</h3>
      <p>Select the oversized <strong>vintage camera dwelling</strong> and place it in the center-left grassy area, flush with the river’s edge. Ensure it locks into place without tilting forward or back.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Drape string lights and climbing vines</h3>
      <p>Add <strong>multicolored string lights</strong> across the front roof edge. Tuck <em>green vines</em> into the side crevices, letting foliage spill naturally to soften the structure.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Place squirrel figurine and telescope</h3>
      <p>On the camera rooftop, position a <strong>squirrel figurine</strong> beside a <strong>telescope</strong> angled toward the waterfall. Adjust slightly left to avoid overlapping the lights.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Add wooden table with umbrella and picnic set</h3>
      <p>On the right rooftop plateau, place a <strong>round wooden table</strong>, insert the red-and-white umbrella, and arrange <em>two sandwiches</em> plus a <em>lemonade glass</em> for a cozy picnic scene.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 5: Attach the bunny climber</h3>
      <p>Snap the <strong>bunny figurine</strong> onto the camera lens area so it looks like it’s climbing up. Leave spacing from the vines to avoid placement conflict.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 6: Position the yellow camper van</h3>
      <p>Park the <strong>yellow camper van</strong> beneath the camera’s overhang, angled toward the river. Ensure the wheels sit flush with the grass terrain.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 7: Load rooftop gear and set up canopy lounge</h3>
      <p>Stack a <strong>sleeping mat</strong>, <strong>crate</strong>, and <strong>duffel bag</strong> neatly on the van roof. Extend a striped <strong>awning canopy</strong> and place two <em>camping chairs</em> plus a <em>side table</em> underneath for a complete lounge.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 8: Arrange ground details</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Create a <strong>campfire</strong> with logs, tripod, and stew pot.</li>
      <li>Add <em>mushrooms</em> and bushes for woodland accents.</li>
      <li>Stack crates with a curious <strong>grey cat</strong> pawing at the top.</li>
      <li>Pitch a <strong>yellow tent</strong> with flag and lights.</li>
      <li>Place a <strong>canoe</strong> in the river with a paddling <strong>black-and-white cat</strong>.</li>
      <li>Add <em>lily pads</em> and a <em>frog figurine</em> for finishing touches.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Watch for <strong>green snap guides</strong> to confirm accurate placement.</li>
      <li>If an item won’t register, rotate by 15° or nudge one grid unit.</li>
      <li>Props like vines and bunny climber need spacing to avoid overlap conflicts.</li>
      <li>Use the <strong>move tool</strong> instead of undo to prevent reverting correct placements.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Memorize key <strong>alignment hotspots</strong> like van racks and tent pegs.</li>
      <li>Use <em>ghost mode</em> to preview layering before dropping props.</li>
      <li>Group and clone similar foliage assets for quicker decoration.</li>
      <li>Rotate animal props by 22.5° increments for natural poses.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Final Scene Description</h2>
      <p>The finished Level 117 scene showcases a riverside campsite anchored by a giant camera house. A squirrel peers through a telescope, a picnic sits under an umbrella, and a bunny climbs the lens. Below, a camper van with rooftop gear and canopy lounge sits by a glowing campfire, while cats explore crates, tents, and a canoe on the river. Frogs, lily pads, and lush vines complete the playful, storybook atmosphere.</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Place the bathtub</h3>
      <p>Drag the <strong>white-and-aqua bathtub</strong> to the upper-left corner, flush against both walls. Ensure it doesn’t overlap the drainage outlet for proper faucet placement.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Install shower rod and glass partition</h3>

      <p>Place the <strong>yellow utility cart</strong> to the right of the tub, fill it with <em>soda bottles</em> and <em>jars</em>, then rotate slightly for alignment with the bathroom door.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 5: Place pink mini fridge</h3>
      <p>Set the <strong>pink mini fridge</strong> near the bed area, leaving one grid unit of clearance by the stairs. Add <em>two bottles</em> on top for extra detail.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 6: Assemble double bed</h3>
      <p>Place the <strong>double bed</strong> against the right wall, under the upcoming window. Add the <em>fish-pattern blanket</em> and two pillows, adjusting for symmetry.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 7: Add window with curtains</h3>
      <p>Install the <strong>arched window</strong> above the bed, then hang <strong>blue-and-yellow curtains</strong> with a yellow valance for contrast.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 8: Build the staircase</h3>
      <p>Place the <strong>staircase</strong> in the front-left area, ensuring it aligns with the platform. Attach the <em>teal handrail</em> for stability.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 9: Install cabinets and countertop</h3>
      <p>Place three <strong>teal base cabinets</strong> with gold handles on the lower back wall. Add the <strong>countertop</strong> on top, preparing for sink and stove placement.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 10: Add stove, oven, pan, and cutting board</h3>
      <p>Insert the <strong>stove-oven unit</strong> into the countertop cutout. Place a <em>frying pan</em> on the burner and a <em>cutting board</em> angled on the left side.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 11: Position TV, stand, and speaker</h3>
      <p>Place the <strong>TV stand</strong> on the lower right wall, add the <strong>flat-screen TV</strong> on top, and situate the <strong>tall silver speaker</strong> to the side.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 12: Arrange sofa, coffee table, plants, and rugs</h3>
      <p>Place the <strong>mint-green sofa</strong> facing the TV with the <strong>coffee table</strong> in front. Add a <em>green rug</em> at the staircase base and a <em>beige rug</em> under the sofa. Finish with <em>potted plants</em> near the window and sofa.</p>
      
      <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>

      <li>Save custom setups (bathroom, kitchen) as <em>Favorites</em> for reuse.</li>
      <li>Use inventory search to quickly find props like “bathtub” or “stove.”</li>
      <li>Enable shadow overlay to preview lighting and avoid odd silhouettes.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Final Scene Description</h2>
      <p>The finished Level 118 scene is a pastel two-level retreat. Upstairs, a white-and-aqua bathtub with a golden mirror, towel, and pet window adds charm. A pink mini fridge stands beside a cozy double bed under a curtained arched window. Below, teal cabinets with gold handles and a stove create a stylish kitchen, while a mint sofa and coffee table face a TV setup. Plants, rugs, and thoughtful décor complete the warm, storybook-like retreat.</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 119 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>Dreamy Room Level 119 builds on the core Dreamy Room experience, emphasizing mindful decoration and memory storytelling. In this guide, you’ll transform the empty canvas into a bustling space station-themed room, placing every object in its perfect spot.</p>
      
      <img src="/images/guides_119_1.webp" alt="Level 119 of the Dreamy Room game" />

      <h3>Step 1: Place the base platform and back walls</h3>
      <p>Lay down the cream-colored floor tile and align it with the bottom edge. Add the two perpendicular back walls snug into the corners. Ensure the grooves and etched lines mirror for a balanced foundation.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Place left scaffolding, crates, and control console</h3>
      <p>Add the beige lattice scaffolding on the left, stack two light-blue crates on the walkway, and position the compact control console below with its green screen facing outward.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Place the NASA rocket in the center</h3>
      <p>Set the red-and-white NASA rocket in the platform’s center. Use the alignment guide to ensure it’s perfectly vertical, with the “NASA” lettering facing the front.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Place right scaffolding, pulley winch, and crate</h3>
      <p>Mirror the left with scaffolding on the right. Place the pulley winch on top, add a light-green crate, and confirm both scaffolds align at the same height.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 5: Connect piping between scaffolds and rocket</h3>
      <p>Attach the elbow pipe from the left scaffold into the rocket’s port. Add a straight pipe connecting the rocket to the right scaffold winch, ensuring airtight alignment.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 6: Add satellite dish, energy orb, and wind turbine fan</h3>
      <p>Mount the satellite dish on the left scaffold, position the glowing pink energy orb at its focal point, and place the blue turbine fan in front, facing outward.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 7: Set up the command desk with laptop, books, and plant</h3>
      <p>Place the mint-green desk in the front-right quadrant. Add a laptop, two stacked books, a succulent, and small accessories like a pencil and ergonomic mouse ball.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 8: Place the water tower and auxiliary tank</h3>
      <p>Position the blue-domed water tower in the front-right corner, and place the short cylindrical tank beside it, leaving a gap for precision.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 9: Add NASA signage and nameplate</h3>
      <p>Mount the rectangular NASA logo on the right scaffolding and the smaller nameplate at the front-left platform edge for thematic cohesion.</p>
      
      <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Check alignment: Dreamy Room Level 119 enforces strict grid snapping.</li>
      <li>Ensure scaffolding connects flush against back walls.</li>
      <li>Rotate objects before placing to face correctly.</li>
      <li>Save progress often to avoid resets.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Use guide overlays to align scaffolding perfectly.</li>
      <li>Place large structures first, then props.</li>
      <li>Zoom out for symmetry checks.</li>
      <li>Use keyboard shortcuts (R to rotate, arrow keys to nudge).</li>
      <li>Enable color-blind mode to distinguish crates and pipes.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Final Scene Description</h2>
      <p>The finished Level 119 scene resembles a nostalgic space launch station. A central NASA rocket rises between beige scaffolds, with crates, consoles, pipes, and a satellite dish beaming energy. A turbine fan spins below, while a mint-green command desk, water tower, and tank sit at the front. NASA signage completes the industrial vibe, and tiny fox-like engineers bring the diorama to life. Dreamy Room Level 119 captures the perfect balance of industry and whimsy.</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 120 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>Dreamy Room Level 120 transforms a blank stone chamber into an enchanting medieval workshop. In this guide, you’ll master the placement of every rack, ladder, banner, and bench for a perfectly immersive scene.</p>
      
      <img src="/images/guides_120_1.webp" alt="Level 120 of the Dreamy Room game" />

      <h3>Step 1: Place the Boot Rack and Weapon Rack</h3>
      <p>Position the wooden boot rack in the bottom-left corner, flush against the wall. Place the fence-style weapon stand in front, leaning axes and spears neatly.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Install the Ladder, Window, and Greenery</h3>
      <p>Lean the ladder on the left wall, add the arched window above its midpoint, and drape trailing vines from the window’s top edge for a cozy corner.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Hang the Decorative Banner</h3>
      <p>Mount the green heraldic banner with gold emblem high on the left wall, centered above the ladder and window.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Install the Second-Floor Railing</h3>
      <p>Snap railing posts along the open upper story, spanning left to right. Ensure all posts connect without gaps for realism.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 5: Set Up the Dining Nook</h3>
      <p>Place the round table and two chairs on the loft. Add a golden decanter, crystal goblet, and roasted chicken plate for a warm medieval dining scene.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 6: Add the Potted Plant</h3>
      <p>Snap the green potted plant to the railing, letting leaves drape outward for natural balance.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 7: Position the Cabinet of Scrolls and Potions</h3>
      <p>Place the tall cabinet on the back wall of the loft, then fill its cubbies with scrolls, potion bottles, and tomes.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 8: Place the Small Stool</h3>
      <p>Set the round wooden stool with cushion beside the cabinet, angled outward as if ready for a scholar.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 9: Build the Blacksmith’s Bench</h3>
      <p>On the lower floor, place the blacksmith’s bench, golden anvil, and vice. Align everything flush with the platform edges.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 10: Add Blacksmith Character and Helmets</h3>
      <p>Position the cat-like blacksmith NPC mid-swing at the anvil, and line up three helmets on the bench surface.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 11: Position the Knight, Shields, and Swords</h3>
      <p>Place the armored knight near the bench. Mount three shields on the right wall in a gentle arc, with sword racks beneath them.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 12: Mount Trophy, Crates, and Candles</h3>
      <p>Hang the deer head trophy above the shields. Add greenery crates in the bottom-right corner, and place two lit candles for atmospheric light.</p>
      
      <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Always follow snapping guides to avoid clipping issues.</li>
      <li>Do not push cabinets too close to corners or they may float.</li>

      <li>Hold Shift to disable snapping for fine adjustments.</li>
      <li>Save before adding NPCs to avoid rework from reset bugs.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Final Scene Description</h2>
      <p>The finished Level 120 is a bustling medieval workshop. A boot rack and weapon stand occupy the bottom-left corner, while a ladder leads to a cozy loft. The upper story holds a dining nook with roasted chicken, a tall cabinet filled with scrolls and potions, and greenery draping from an arched window. A heraldic banner and candles cast a warm glow. Below, a cat-like blacksmith hammers at the anvil as a knight observes. Shields, swords, crates of greenery, and a deer trophy complete the immersive atelier.</p>
