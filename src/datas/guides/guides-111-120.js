        "detailsHtml": `<h2>Dreamy Room Level 111 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
            <p>Dreamy Room Level 111 centers around transforming an empty room into a lively factory loft with two distinct levels and multiple work zones. Precision placement is key to successfully completing this design-focused level. Follow these steps to ensure everything snaps into place perfectly.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 1: Place the sliding door on the left wall</h3>
            <p>Begin by positioning the sliding door on the left wall panel, aligning its bottom edge with the floor and its frame within the rectangular recess. This is the foundation for your design, so proper grid alignment is critical. Ensure the door snaps cleanly into place before moving on.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 2: Assemble the elevated walkway and conveyor crates</h3>
            <p>Next, assemble the central elevated walkway. Place the L-shaped platform segment one tile above the floor against the back wall. Attach the straight connector piece to extend it to the right, creating a T-shaped catwalk. Afterward, place four sky-blue crates at even intervals on the walkway, making sure they snap into the conveyor rails.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 3: Set up the delivery van and green bunny worker</h3>
            <p>On the lower-left grid tile, place the white-and-blue delivery van right next to the sliding door. Ensure its wheels align with the floor seams. Then, place the green bunny worker on the van’s rear platform, with its front paws resting on the rear crate. Look for the highlight indicator that confirms a correct drop.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 4: Place the robotic assembly arms and the central bunny mech</h3>
            <p>Focus on the central assembly node. Select the pair of robotic arm pieces and anchor each base onto the white mounting blocks on the floor grid. Swivel the joints outward to create a symmetrical V-shape. Place the larger green bunny mech body precisely between the two arms, making sure its limbs align with their gripping claws.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 5: Arrange the packing station and secondary bunny packer</h3>
            <p>Set up the packing station on the right side of the assembly area. Place the blue table module on the right-side grid and ensure its legs are flush with the floor. Put the cyan basket on the right side of the table. Position the green bunny packer figure in front of the basket, then mount the small wall console with its glowing screen above the table.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 6: Install the glass control booth and manager's desk</h3>
            <p>For the grand finale, install the transparent glass control booth atop the elevated walkway. Snap its four corner pillars into the platform’s sockets. Next, place the blue desk piece in the center against the booth's back wall. Arrange the computer monitors on the desk, with the large central screen flanked by two smaller ones. Finally, add the coffee cup, printer, wastebasket, and the bespectacled bunny supervisor in the swivel chair.</p>
      
            <h2>Tips for Dreamy Room Level 111</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Activate the grid snap:</strong> This feature helps you see faint outlines before dropping objects, ensuring perfect alignment.</li>
              <li><strong>Start with large pieces:</strong> Placing the sliding door and elevated walkway first anchors your layout and makes subsequent placements easier.</li>
              <li><strong>Check for the glow:</strong> Correctly placed items will often glow or snap with a satisfying sound. If an item jitters or won't snap, it's likely misaligned.</li>
            </ul>
      
            <h2>Walkthrough Strategy</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Layout the foundation:</strong> Secure the door and walkway before adding any other items.</li>
              <li><strong>Build work zones:</strong> Create the delivery, assembly, and packing stations one by one.</li>
              <li><strong>Add characters and details last:</strong> Place the bunny workers, manager, and other small accessories to bring the scene to life.</li>
            </ul>
      
            <p>Following this Dreamy Room Level 111 solution walkthrough will help you build a charming factory loft with perfect symmetry and an efficient layout.</p>`

            <p>Dreamy Room Level 112 challenges you to transform a blank stone chamber into a captivating treasure vault filled with secrets and adventure. Precision placement is key to successfully completing this design-focused level. Follow these steps to ensure everything snaps into place perfectly.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 1: Place the vault door, gear panel, and lever</h3>
            <p>Begin by placing the large, circular vault door on the left wall, centering it horizontally just above the floor. Next, position the small gear control panel to the right of the vault door, followed by the red-handled lever. Ensure the panel and lever are slightly separated to avoid any collision.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 2: Place the weapon stand with axe and musket</h3>
            <p>Position the purple weapon stand under the metal railing on the left wall. Place the double-headed axe in the left notch and the musket in the right notch. Make sure both weapons are nestled snugly without overlapping the railing or floor.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 3: Decorate the walls with various items</h3>
            <p>Mount the deer head trophy above the wooden shelf, centering the antlers between the vault door and the corner support. Install the wooden cabinet below the trophy. Hang the gold-framed mirror to the right of the shelf, and then place the ornate lantern sconce next to the mirror. Finally, fit the arched wooden door over the curved right wall opening and place three wooden pegs beneath it.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 4: Arrange the statue and cushioned chest under the staircase</h3>
            <p>In the alcove under the staircase, place the draped statue with a glowing purple orb on the tall column at the back. Slide it inward slightly so the orb is visible. Position the purple-cushioned chest directly beneath the stairs, tucking it against the curved wall for a snug fit. Adjust both items to avoid overlap with the stairs.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 5: Curate the central jewelry display</h3>
            <p>Center the long wooden display table in the middle of the room. Drape the red runner cloth over its surface. Place the golden jewelry bust in the center of the table, draping a pearl necklace over its shoulders. Arrange the sapphire-blue diamond gem to the right of the bust, and two leather-bound scroll cases and a rustic mug to the left. Lean three rolled rugs against the back of the table and place a wooden barrel adjacent to its right corner.</p>
      
            <h3>Step 6: Fill the floor with treasure chests and study items</h3>
            <p>In the bottom-left corner, set an open treasure chest spilling gold coins next to a closed one. Position a burlap sack of coins and a separate pile of scattered gold with an ornate sword laid across it. Stack three barrels to the right of the coin pile. In the right alcove, arrange the round wooden side table, laying out an open book, three stacked tomes, a quill, a mug, and a golden key. Finally, place the rocking chair facing the table for a cozy touch.</p>
      
            <h2>Tips for Dreamy Room Level 112</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Use the grid overlay:</strong> Toggle the grid overlay to gain precision when aligning items.</li>
              <li><strong>Avoid overlaps:</strong> Be careful not to overlap items with fixed elements like stairs or railings, as this can cause placement issues.</li>
              <li><strong>Nudge for perfection:</strong> Since object rotation is preset, use subtle nudges with the arrow keys to achieve perfect placement.</li>
            </ul>
      
            <h2>Walkthrough Strategy</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Start with the walls:</strong> Placing the vault door and other wall decor first establishes the room’s main structure.</li>
              <li><strong>Build the central display:</strong> Curating the jewelry table early on creates a focal point for the rest of the room.</li>
              <li><strong>Fill the floor last:</strong> Use treasure chests, barrels, and study items to fill the remaining space and add character to the scene.</li>
            </ul>
      
            <p>Following this Dreamy Room Level 112 solution walkthrough will help you build a mysterious and luxurious treasure vault with perfect symmetry and an adventurous narrative.</p>`

          <p>Dreamy Room Level 113 invites you to transform a plain stone chamber into an <strong>enchanted indoor garden</strong> filled with glowing flora, sparkling crystals, and mystical fountains. Careful placement of natural and magical elements is the key to success in this level.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 1: Place the central fountain</h3>
          <p>Start by positioning the circular stone fountain in the middle of the room. Ensure the water spouts face upward and the glowing lilies are visible around the rim. This will serve as the garden’s centerpiece.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 2: Arrange glowing plants and vines</h3>
          <p>Attach glowing ivy vines along the left and right walls, making sure they drape naturally without covering the fountain. Place two potted glowing mushrooms on either side of the fountain for balance. Position the tall crystal-flower plant near the left corner.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 3: Add magical crystals and artifacts</h3>
          <p>Cluster three radiant crystals in the back alcove, ensuring their glow illuminates the surrounding plants. Place a small stone pedestal near the crystals and set a magical orb on top. To the right wall, hang a rune-carved plaque to add arcane flair.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 4: Create the seating nook</h3>
          <p>In the lower-right corner, place the wooden bench with vine carvings. Add a soft green cushion on the bench. Position a round side table next to it, placing a glowing book, a tea mug, and a small lantern on its surface for a cozy touch.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 5: Add floor details and finishing touches</h3>
          <p>Scatter a few stepping stones leading from the doorway to the fountain. Place a basket of herbs and a watering can near the bench. Finally, arrange two luminous butterflies above the fountain for a magical finishing detail.</p>
      
          <h2>Tips for Dreamy Room Level 113</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Balance natural and magical elements:</strong> Don’t overcrowd one side of the room with glowing objects—spread them evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Use symmetry:</strong> The fountain serves as the center; align items symmetrically for a pleasing look.</li>
            <li><strong>Mind visibility:</strong> Make sure glowing plants and crystals are not hidden behind walls or furniture.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h2>Walkthrough Strategy</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with the centerpiece:</strong> The fountain should be placed first to guide all other arrangements.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer natural décor:</strong> Add vines and plants before artifacts to ensure proper layering.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalize the nook:</strong> The seating corner gives the room a lived-in, enchanting feel—decorate it thoughtfully.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Level 114 turns a bare stone room into a <strong>Celestial Observatory</strong>. Precision matters: align optical devices with the star dome, maintain walkway clearance, and keep the scholarly corner tidy for an elegant, functional layout.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 1: Install the rotating star dome</h3>
          <p>Mount the segmented <em>star dome</em> across the ceiling. Center the main circular aperture over the room’s midpoint so projected constellations land symmetrically on the walls. Nudge until the dome ribs align with the room’s corner pillars.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 2: Anchor the brass telescope and tripod</h3>
          <p>Place the <strong>brass telescope</strong> on its tripod near the front-right quadrant, aimed toward the dome’s aperture. Ensure the eyepiece clears the railing and that the tripod legs don’t clip the floor trim. Add the adjustment wheel panel to the right side of the mount.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 3: Set the orrery and instrument pedestal</h3>
          <p>Position the <strong>orrery</strong> (miniature solar system) on a waist-high pedestal left of center, leaving walking space between it and the telescope. Rotate it so the largest ring faces outward. Place the small <em>instrument tray</em> beside it with calipers, a sextant, and a pocket watch.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 4: Hang constellation charts and wall plaques</h3>
          <p>On the back wall, hang the three <strong>constellation charts</strong> in a horizontal line: Northern, Equatorial, Southern. Keep equal spacing and align their bottom edges. Add two brass <em>star plaques</em> above the side arches for visual balance, and a crescent-moon sconce between the charts.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 5: Build the scholar’s desk nook</h3>
          <p>In the lower-left corner, place the <strong>oak desk</strong> facing inward. Add a leather chair slightly angled toward the telescope. On the desk, arrange an open atlas, quill & inkwell, rolled ephemerides (two stacked, one tied), and a dim desk lamp. Slide a narrow bookshelf behind the chair with logbooks and a boxed lens kit.</p>
      
          <h3>Step 6: Floor markers, ladder, and finishing details</h3>
          <p>Lay a circular <em>compass rug</em> beneath the dome center. Place the collapsible <strong>ladder</strong> near the back-right pillar to suggest access for dome maintenance. Scatter three star stones along the rug’s perimeter and place a covered crate of spare lenses near the doorway without blocking the path.</p>
      
          <h2>Tips for Dreamy Room Level 114</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mind sightlines:</strong> Keep the telescope’s beam path clear of shelves and sconces.</li>
            <li><strong>Symmetry matters:</strong> Charts and plaques should mirror the dome ribs for a clean look.</li>
            <li><strong>Leave walk space:</strong> Maintain a clear corridor between the orrery and the desk nook.</li>
            <li><strong>Use gentle nudges:</strong> Micro-adjust with arrow keys for perfect edge alignment.</li>
