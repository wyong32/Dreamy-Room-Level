          <h2>Dreamy Room Level 21 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
          <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 21! In this level, you’ll set up a charming campsite scene complete with tents, a camper van, palm trees, a campfire, and more. Follow the detailed instructions below to achieve the perfect outdoor setup.</p>
      
          <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>
      
          <h4>Step 1: Set the Palm Tree</h4>
          <p>Place the tall palm tree on the far right side of the space. Make sure its leaves extend near the top edge without blocking the tents.</p>
      
          <h4>Step 2: Position the Camper Van</h4>
          <p>Place the pastel camper van toward the back-left corner of the space. Ensure the ladder is visible and angled properly.</p>
      
          <h4>Step 3: Attach the Awning</h4>
          <p>Attach the striped awning to the side of the camper van, extending outward and aligning it with the van’s roof.</p>
      
          <h4>Step 4: Place the Larger Yellow Tent</h4>
          <p>Position the bright yellow tent just to the right of center. Make sure it’s clearly visible and not obstructed by the palm tree.</p>
      
          <h4>Step 5: Set the Smaller Tent</h4>
          <p>Place the smaller pastel-colored tent next to the camper van on the left side, balancing the diorama’s layout.</p>
      
          <h4>Step 6: Hang the Bunting Flags</h4>
          <p>String the colorful flags across the top of the scene, from the palm tree side to the camper van side. This creates a festive atmosphere.</p>
      
          <h4>Step 7: Arrange the Clothesline</h4>
          <p>Place the clothesline near the back, stretching between the camper van and the palm tree. Hang small clothes and towels for a cozy touch.</p>
      
          <h4>Step 8: Build the Campfire</h4>
          <p>Position the campfire in the center of the space between the tents, ensuring there’s enough room for characters to sit around it.</p>
      
          <h4>Step 9: Scatter the Camping Accessories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Lean the guitar against the yellow tent.</li>
            <li>Place a small table with food near the campfire.</li>
            <li>Lay a sleeping mat or cushion beside the campfire.</li>
            <li>Scatter stones and miscellaneous items around the tents and palm tree for a natural feel.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h4>Step 10: Add the Final Touches</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Place a second small ladder leaning against the front edge of the open container.</li>
            <li>Seat characters around the campfire for a more realistic setup.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Check Object Snap Points:</strong> Some items may snap into specific spots. Move items gently until they lock into place.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Overlapping:</strong> Ensure larger objects do not overlap, as this can prevent proper placement of smaller items.</li>
            <li><strong>Palm Tree Placement:</strong> Position the palm tree at the far right to avoid obstruction of flags or other items.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Use the Camper Van as a Reference:</strong> The van is a great anchor point for organizing the layout of other objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Group Similar Items:</strong> Keep items like tents, campfire accessories, and decorative flags together before placing them.</li>
            <li><strong>Rotate for Better Angles:</strong> Rotate the scene to view placement from different angles, ensuring everything is perfectly aligned.</li>
            <li><strong>Save Frequently:</strong> Save your progress regularly in case any items need to be adjusted.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p>With these steps and tips in mind, you’ll be able to set up the perfect campsite and complete Dreamy Room Level 21 with ease. Enjoy creating this outdoor haven!</p>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>
  
      <h4>Step 1: Place the Washing Machine</h4>
      <p>Position the washing machine against the back wall on the left side. This will be the anchor for your laundry setup.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 2: Position the Dryer</h4>
      <p>Place the dryer right next to the washing machine, ensuring they are side by side for a realistic laundry setup.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 3: Arrange Detergent on Top of the Dryer</h4>
      <p>Stack the detergent bottles and the “SUPER CLEAN” detergent box on top of the dryer, keeping everything neat and organized.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 4: Hang the Wall Shelf</h4>
      <p>Install the small shelf or window frame above the washing machine and dryer. Place a potted plant or decorative item on the shelf to add charm.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 5: Mount the Coat Rack</h4>
      <p>Near the entryway on the left wall, mount the coat rack and hang a few colorful clothes or towels on it for a laundry-themed touch.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 6: Position the Laundry Basket</h4>
      <p>Place a wicker laundry basket in the front-left corner of the room, and add a potted plant next to it for a fresh, inviting look.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 7: Set Up the Drying Rack</h4>
      <p>Place the folding drying rack on the right side of the room and drape the purple cloth or towel over it to complete the scene.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 8: Place the Hamper or Basket of Towels</h4>
      <p>Position the hamper or small basket filled with towels near the back right corner of the room to maintain an organized layout.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 9: Add the Ironing Board</h4>
      <p>Set up the ironing board in front of the machines, with enough space to move around comfortably. This is a key item in the laundry area.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 10: Add the Final Laundry Basket</h4>
      <p>Place an additional laundry basket beneath or beside the ironing board to finish the laundry setup.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spacing Matters:</strong> Be sure to leave enough room between items to avoid overcrowding, which could make it hard to complete the level.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper Rotation:</strong> Some objects may need to be rotated to fit snugly against walls or other items.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Overlaps:</strong> Avoid overlapping items, as the game may not allow this and it could prevent correct placement.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start with Large Items:</strong> Begin by placing the washing machine, dryer, and drying rack first. These larger items anchor the layout of the room.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilize Vertical Space:</strong> Mount shelves and coat racks high on the walls to save floor space and increase the room's functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Group Similar Items:</strong> Keep laundry-related items, such as detergents and baskets, grouped together for better organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Decorative Touches:</strong> Use plants and colorful textiles to brighten up the space without sacrificing functionality.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following these steps, you'll successfully create a well-organized and cozy laundry space in Dreamy Room Level 22. Good luck, and enjoy decorating!</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 23 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 23! In this level, you’ll transform an empty room into a salon-like space with all the necessary furniture and accessories. Follow the steps below for the perfect arrangement.</p>
  
      <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>
  
      <h4>Step 1: Place the Exterior Sign</h4>
      <p>Position the large, round sign featuring a stylized cat silhouette on the outer left wall of the room. It should protrude slightly outside to indicate it's a shop sign.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 2: Lay Down the Floor Extension</h4>
      <p>Place the small rectangular platform extending from the room’s entrance. Align the green-and-white checkered tiles on this platform for a welcoming look.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 3: Set the Tall Potted Plant</h4>
      <p>Place the tall evergreen potted plant on the left edge, just before the checkered floor transitions into the main area. It will frame the entrance beautifully.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 4: Position the “Price List” Board</h4>
      <p>Place the pink “Price List” board next to the plant, facing outward to display the salon’s services.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 5: Arrange the Wig Stand</h4>
      <p>In the front-right corner of the entrance area, position the wig stand with two wigs displayed prominently.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 6: Set the Salon Chair and Sink</h4>
      <p>Place the light-green salon chair and the hair-washing sink behind it in the center. Ensure the chair faces the sink for a realistic salon setup.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 7: Place the Partition with Glass Panels</h4>
      <p>Add the partition with glass windows behind the salon chair. This will subtly divide the space while maintaining an open feel.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 8: Arrange the Window and Vanity Items</h4>
      <p>Install the large window with pink trim on the left wall. Place vanity lights across the top of the window and set makeup brushes, a hairdryer, and a comb on the sill.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 9: Install the Air Conditioner and Hanging Vines</h4>
      <p>Mount the white air conditioner near the top of the back wall or above the partition. Add hanging vines around the AC unit for a fresh look.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 10: Place the Green Sofa and Pink Hair Steamer</h4>
      <p>In the back-right corner, position the light-green sofa with matching pillows. Place the pink dome-shaped hair steamer just to the right of it.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 11: Set Up the Desk and Computer</h4>
      <p>Place the small desk and pink register/computer near the sofa. Include a credit card machine and a stack of magazines or books next to it for added detail.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 12: Decorate with Additional Shelves and Wall Accents</h4>
      <p>Attach a floating shelf above the desk to hold small bottles of hair products. Hang a framed picture with a pink cat silhouette on the right wall and line the platform’s front edge with flower boxes.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Object Overlap:</strong> Some items may overlap if placed incorrectly. Ensure that each item is anchored correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> Rotate furniture like the salon chair or sofa to ensure proper placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Space Management:</strong> Avoid overcrowding; ensure each item fits within the designated space for a functional salon setup.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use the Partition:</strong> The partition helps to divide the salon while offering space for vines or décor to enhance the ambiance.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the Outlines:</strong> Hover objects over their intended spot to see a faint outline. This will confirm the exact placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Group Similar Items:</strong> Keep styling tools like hairdryers, combs, and brushes together for easier arrangement.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Rush:</strong> Take your time rotating and positioning each item. There’s no time limit, so ensure everything is perfect.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following these steps and tips, you’ll successfully turn the empty room into a fully functioning and stylish salon in Dreamy Room Level 23. With each item placed correctly, you’ll overcome the main challenge of proper placement. Enjoy decorating!</p>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>
  
      <h4>Step 1: Position the Bed Near the Left Wall</h4>
      <p>Start by placing the single bed against the left wall, ensuring it’s parallel. Add a soft pink blanket and matching pillow for the perfect cozy look.</p>

      <h4>Step 4: Set Up the Second Bed by the Curved Window</h4>

      </ul>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 25 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 25! In this level, your challenge is to create a serene, Japanese-inspired retreat. Follow the detailed instructions below to position each item in its perfect spot and transform the room into a tranquil haven.</p>
  
      <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>
  
      <h4>Step 1: Place the Bed in the Center of the Back Wall</h4>
      <p>Position the large bed with the green swirling duvet against the back wall, ensuring it’s centered. This is a key starting point in Dreamy Room Level 25, as it helps balance the overall room layout.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 2: Hang the Circular Wall Art Above the Bed</h4>
      <p>Above the head of the bed, hang a round painting or clock featuring a cherry blossom branch. This artwork adds a calming, serene atmosphere and ties the design together.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 3: Arrange the Side Lanterns Beside the Bed</h4>
      <p>Place the tall rectangular lanterns on both sides of the bed. The soft glow they provide will frame the bed and enhance the tranquil vibe of Dreamy Room Level 25.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 4: Position the Low Tea Table to the Right</h4>
      <p>On the right side of the room, place a small wooden tea table in the center of that section. This tea table will become the focal point for the Japanese-inspired tea corner.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 5: Add the Fox Figure and Cushion at the Tea Table</h4>
      <p>Seat the fox character (wearing a traditional kimono mask) on a green cushion at the tea table. Make sure the fox faces inward toward the bed for the perfect touch of personality.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 6: Place the Teapot and Accessories on the Table</h4>
      <p>On the tea table, arrange the black teapot and accompanying tea cups. These items emphasize the significance of a cozy tea ritual and contribute to the peaceful ambiance.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 7: Install the Wall Shelf on the Right Wall</h4>
      <p>Affix a small wall shelf above the tea table. On this shelf, place a decorative vase and an additional tea set item. Properly balancing these items is essential to maintaining the aesthetic harmony of the space.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 8: Create the Onsen Area in the Left Corner</h4>
      <p>In the left corner of the room, set up a small hot-spring pool (onsen). Add the three pink floating creatures inside the pool and place a wooden bucket nearby. This addition creates a playful spa element in Dreamy Room Level 25.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 9: Add the Bamboo Plant and Wooden Partition</h4>
      <p>Behind the onsen, place a tall bamboo plant for an extra touch of nature. If available, position a short wooden partition or screen near the bath area to complete the tranquil, Japanese-inspired setup.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check object placement carefully:</strong> Even slight misalignments can prevent level completion. Adjust everything to ensure correct placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Mind the scale of objects:</strong> Larger pieces like the bed and onsen should not overlap. Leave enough space for the game to recognize the arrangement.</li>
        <li><strong>Handle fragile items last:</strong> Place delicate décor items like vases or tea accessories after positioning the main furniture.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Preview the final look:</strong> Use the in-game preview feature to check your placement before finalizing the layout.</li>
        <li><strong>Work from back to front:</strong> Start with larger items like the bed and wall art, then move on to smaller items like the tea table, fox figure, and onsen details.</li>
        <li><strong>Save frequently:</strong> Make use of the save option to preserve your progress after each major placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilize the grid:</strong> If the grid lines are available, use them to align larger objects like the bed and lanterns for precise positioning.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following these detailed steps, you’ll transform the room into a peaceful, Japanese-inspired retreat in Dreamy Room Level 25. Focus on exact placement for a tranquil, harmonious space, and enjoy the results!</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 26 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 26! This level focuses on creating a cozy, cat-themed haven. Follow these steps carefully to ensure perfect placement of each item and create a whimsical, cat-friendly space!</p>
  
      <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>
  
      <h4>Step 1: Place the Bed in the Back-Right Corner</h4>
      <p>Start by moving the purple bed into the back-right corner of the room. Make sure it’s aligned with both the right and back walls. Top it off with a pink paw-print pillow and a soft purple blanket to create a cozy vibe.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 2: Hang the Purple Curtains and String Lights</h4>
      <p>Behind the bed, hang purple curtains to frame the window area. Drape the string of fairy lights across the top edge of the wall above the curtains. This will add a warm, dreamy glow to the room.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 3: Position the Brown Bear Plush on the Bed</h4>
      <p>Place the brown bear plush on the bed, positioned to the right of the pink pillow. The plush adds a whimsical touch and enhances the coziness of Dreamy Room Level 26.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 4: Set Up the White Plush on the Chair</h4>
      <p>On the right side of the room, add the pink armchair. Place the white plush with a tiny halo on the chair to balance out the room's layout and add a cute element.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 5: Arrange the Cat Tower and Hammock on the Left</h4>
      <p>On the left side, set up the tall green cat tower. Position the hanging hammock just beside it with a small plant. This creates a cozy cat corner that’s essential for Dreamy Room Level 26.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 6: Place the Pink Cat House and Feeding Station</h4>
      <p>Place the pink cat house in front of the cat tower and arrange the food and water bowls outside it. This ensures your virtual cat has everything it needs to feel at home in Dreamy Room Level 26.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 7: Put the Gray Cat on the Circular Platform</h4>
      <p>Position the raised circular platform in the center of the room and place the gray cat figure on top. This centerpiece is one of the iconic elements of Dreamy Room Level 26 and ties the theme together.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 8: Add the Pink Floor Cushion and Cat Toys</h4>
      <p>To the left of the circular platform, lay down the pink floor cushion. Scatter a few small cat toys (like a feather wand or yarn ball) near the cat tower to create a playful atmosphere.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 9: Furnish the Side Table and Decor</h4>
      <p>Next to the pink armchair, place a small round table with a cup of tea or coffee on top. Hang a trio of cute posters on the wall above the bed. Add a small shelf with books and a flower pot just behind the bed to complete the cozy cat-themed space.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 10: Final Touches</h4>
      <p>Double-check the placement of all items. Ensure that the bed, curtains, cat furniture, and plushies are arranged as described. Once everything is perfectly placed, you’ve successfully transformed the space into a cozy, cat-themed haven.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Watch Your Placement:</strong> In Dreamy Room Level 26, items must be placed precisely. Small misalignments can prevent progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Overlaps:</strong> Avoid overlapping large objects like the bed and cat tower, as this can cause glitches or block certain spots.</li>
        <li><strong>Save Often:</strong> Save your game frequently to avoid losing progress in case of accidental movements.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Preview Before Finalizing:</strong> Temporarily move items around to see how they fit. You can rearrange items before confirming placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Corners Wisely:</strong> Tuck larger furniture (like the bed and cat tower) into corners first, then layer smaller decorations around them.</li>
        <li><strong>Pay Attention to Scale:</strong> If an item seems out of place or off-size, try moving it to another spot to see if it fits better.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate Objects:</strong> Some items, such as plushies or the cat tower, look best when rotated. Experiment with different angles for the best effect.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following these steps and paying attention to detail, you’ll create a cozy, cat-themed haven in Dreamy Room Level 26. Enjoy the process of transforming the space into a whimsical sanctuary filled with plushies, feline comforts, and soft lighting!</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 27 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 27! Your task is to transform the empty space into a cozy, whimsical, storybook-like environment. The main challenge lies in the precise placement of each object. Follow the steps below for a perfect setup!</p>
  
      <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>
  
      <h4>Step 1: Place the Loft Bed in the Upper-Right Corner</h4>
      <p>Start by positioning the loft-style bed against the top-right wall. Align the ladder inward toward the room’s center and make sure the bed’s frame is flush with the right wall to maximize floor space.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 2: Attach the Arched Window Above the Bed</h4>
      <p>Place the arched window directly above the head of the bed. Align the top of the window so it fits snugly along the wall’s curve to maintain the room’s whimsical aesthetic.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 3: Hang the String Lights Along the Top Edge</h4>
      <p>Install the string of glowing lights along the top edge of the right wall, just under the ceiling. This cozy touch adds a dreamy ambiance to Dreamy Room Level 27.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 4: Position the Farmland Painting on the Right Wall</h4>
      <p>Hang the large farmland painting below the string lights and to the right of the ladder. Ensure it’s fully visible and doesn’t overlap the bed or ladder.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 5: Place the Small Poster Near the Bed on the Left Wall</h4>
      <p>On the left wall, slightly above the loft bed, hang the smaller framed poster. This poster typically features a cheerful, cartoon-style image that complements the playful vibe of the room.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 6: Lean the Pink Electric Guitar Beside the Ladder</h4>
      <p>Rest the pink electric guitar against the bed frame or wall near the ladder. This adds a musical touch to the room and showcases the occupant’s interests in Dreamy Room Level 27.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 7: Arrange the Bookshelf with Multi-Colored Books</h4>
      <p>Position the bookshelf beneath the loft bed, between the ladder and desk area. Make sure it’s placed close to the right wall to leave room for the beanbag in the center.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 8: Set Up the Desk and Computer in the Lower-Right Corner</h4>
      <p>Place the desk in the bottom-right corner, facing outward. Add the computer monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Ensure there’s enough space for the office chair.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 9: Place the Office Chair in Front of the Desk</h4>
      <p>Position the office chair so it’s centered on the desk. This will allow for comfortable use of the computer.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 10: Install the Large Window with Curtains on the Left Wall</h4>
      <p>On the left wall, place the large window just above the floor. Hang the curtains so they frame the window gracefully and let in plenty of light.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 11: Add the Potted Plants</h4>
      <p>Place a small potted plant on the shelf or on top of the bookshelf near the bed for a refreshing pop of greenery. Position a larger leafy plant on the floor near the room’s front corner.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 12: Set the Beanbag and Mouse Character in the Center</h4>
      <p>Place the plush beanbag chair in the center of the room. Seat the adorable mouse character on it, giving the room its signature charm.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 13: Place the Footrest and Popcorn Bowl</h4>
      <p>In front of the beanbag, add a small footrest or low stool. On top of this, place a bowl of popcorn to evoke cozy movie or gaming moments.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 14: Position the TV and Game Console</h4>
      <p>Opposite the beanbag, place a small TV stand with the TV on top. Add a game console or controller on the stand to complete the entertainment setup.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 15: Put the Pink Slippers by the Beanbag</h4>
      <p>Place the pair of pink slippers on the floor near the front of the beanbag. This adds a lived-in, cozy feel to the room.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 16: Lay Down the Purple Rug</h4>
      <p>Place the small purple rug beneath the beanbag, with its edges peeking out from under the chair. This adds a pop of color to the wooden floor.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Double-check the bed placement:</strong> Misalignment can cause spacing issues, so ensure the bed is in the right spot.</li>
        <li><strong>Perfectly position the windows:</strong> Overlapping or offset windows can negatively impact your final score.</li>
        <li><strong>Use the game’s grid:</strong> Align the guitar and wall hangings carefully using the grid or alignment guide if available.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Group larger items first:</strong> Place the loft bed, desk, and window first before arranging smaller items.</li>
        <li><strong>Use the grid feature:</strong> If available, use the snap-to or grid feature to simplify alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance the space:</strong> Distribute décor and plants evenly to prevent one side from feeling crowded.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate objects:</strong> Rotate items like the guitar or chair to fit available spaces and avoid overlap.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following these steps, you’ll transform the space into a perfectly decorated room in Dreamy Room Level 27. Enjoy the process of bringing this delightful storybook-inspired room to life!</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 28 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 28! Your mission is to transform the empty suitcase into a vibrant, circus-themed wonderland. Follow these step-by-step instructions to place each object perfectly and complete this playful carnival scene!</p>
  
      <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>
  
      <h4>Step 1: Place the Suitcase and Floor Mat in the Center</h4>
      <p>Begin by opening the empty suitcase and placing it in the center of the room. Inside, ensure the checkered floor mat is fully visible. This suitcase will be the base for all the circus-themed elements.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 2: Attach the “CIRCUS” Sign on the Back Edge</h4>
      <p>Take the large "CIRCUS" sign and attach it to the top edge of the suitcase’s back panel. The sign should arch neatly over the interior, giving it a playful carnival atmosphere.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 3: Install the Gear Handle on the Left Side</h4>
      <p>Fit the gear handle onto the left side of the suitcase. This detail ties into the whimsical, mechanical circus theme and should be placed near the corner of the suitcase exterior.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 4: Slide Out the Bottom Drawer</h4>
      <p>Pull out the hidden drawer at the bottom of the suitcase. It’s essential to keep this drawer fully extended as it will be used to store smaller items and maintain a neat layout.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 5: Position the Carousel at the Center</h4>
      <p>Place the colorful carousel in the center of the suitcase. Make sure it is positioned under the “CIRCUS” sign, creating the focal point of the entire scene.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 6: Place the Clown-Faced Train on the Left Track</h4>
      <p>Move to the left side and position the clown-faced train on the short track. The front of the train should face outward, enhancing the lively, carnival feel of the room.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 7: Add the Target Sign and Carnival Booth on the Left</h4>
      <p>Behind the train, install the circular target sign against the suitcase wall. Next, place the small carnival booth beside it, filling out the left corner of the suitcase with these fun details.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 8: Insert the Clown Steps at the Front</h4>
      <p>Place the short set of clown-faced steps in the front-center of the suitcase. These steps lead up to the carousel and other rides, maintaining the playful vibe of the carnival setup.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 9: Position the Hot Air Balloon on the Right</h4>
      <p>On the right side of the suitcase, attach the pastel hot air balloon. Its canopy should hover above the suitcase, showcasing a whimsical touch with the visible basket facing forward.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 10: Secure the Ferris Wheel Behind the Carousel</h4>
      <p>Finally, place the mini Ferris wheel directly behind the carousel. This addition completes the carnival atmosphere, sitting snugly between the carousel and the “CIRCUS” sign.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Align Objects Carefully:</strong> Ensure all items are aligned correctly, as improper placements can affect the game’s recognition of the layout.</li>
        <li><strong>Drawer Position:</strong> Be sure the bottom drawer is fully extended; retracting it prematurely can prevent certain items from fitting.</li>
        <li><strong>No Overlapping:</strong> Avoid overlapping items, as the game can be strict about hitboxes, and items may not snap into place if there’s overlap.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use the Gear Handle:</strong> Interacting with the gear handle can sometimes shift objects, helping you find the correct placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Start with the Carousel:</strong> Place larger items like the carousel first. Then, fill in smaller pieces around it to maintain a balanced design.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate Objects:</strong> Rotate items until they snap into place for a precise and perfect fit.</li>
        <li><strong>Check All Angles:</strong> If you’re having trouble, try moving the camera around to view the scene from different perspectives. This can help reveal overlooked spots.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following these instructions, you’ll successfully transform the empty suitcase into a lively circus wonderland in Dreamy Room Level 28. Enjoy the colorful, joyful carnival setup!</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 29 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 29! In this level, your mission is to transform a bare two-story space into a charming, pastel-themed retreat. With a cozy bedroom, a functional kitchen, and a comfortable lounge area, this level requires careful placement of each item to create a balanced and inviting atmosphere. Let's get started!</p>
  
      <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>
  
      <h4>Step 1: Place the Bed on the Upper Floor</h4>
      <p>Drag the bed with the purple checkered blanket to the center of the upper floor. Position the heart-shaped pillow at the center of the bed to add a sweet focal point. Ensure the window with pastel curtains is just behind the bed to create a cozy atmosphere. Placing the bed first will set the tone for the entire room.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 2: Arrange the Mirror and Boxes Near the Bed</h4>
      <p>Place the tall pink-framed vanity mirror on the right side of the upper floor, adjacent to the bed. Stack the small cardboard boxes beside the fridge or near the bed's headboard to fill out the space. This ensures that the upper floor is balanced and cozy.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 3: Position the Fridge on the Upper Floor</h4>
      <p>Move the large fridge to the left side of the upper floor, flush against the wall. Tuck any small boxes on top of or next to the fridge to save space. This might seem unusual, but it’s part of the design of Dreamy Room Level 29!</p>
  
      <h4>Step 4: Place the Potted Plant at the Front Edge</h4>
      <p>Select the small potted plant (with a bonsai-like shape) and position it near the edge of the second-floor railing. Place it slightly to the right side of the mirror for balance. This greenery adds a fresh touch to the upper floor.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 5: Set Up the Staircase on the Right</h4>
      <p>Align the floating wooden steps so they lead from the lower floor up to the bedroom. Ensure the staircase seamlessly connects the two levels, providing easy movement between them.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 6: Arrange the Sofa and Coffee Table on the Lower Floor</h4>
      <p>Place the pink-and-purple sofa near the middle of the lower floor, facing outward. Position the small purple coffee table just in front of the sofa. Add the tray, teapot, and game controller on the table to create a cozy lounge space.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 7: Organize the Kitchen and Dining Counter</h4>
      <p>Move the kitchen counter, sink, and stove setup to the left side of the lower floor, directly below the fridge’s position on the upper floor. Place the dining counter with three stools towards the front, leaving room for the sofa behind it. Arrange the kitchen appliances neatly for an organized space.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 8: Final Touches with Wall Décor and Small Accessories</h4>
      <p>Hang the small picture frames and chalkboard on the walls above the bed and near the kitchen. Add any leftover boxes or decor items in empty corners. Check that everything matches the final image’s layout for a polished look.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check Object Interactions:</strong> Some items may not lock into place if nearby objects are misaligned. Adjust items if you encounter placement issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Mind the Two-Story Layout:</strong> Ensure that the upper and lower floor elements align correctly. This is the main challenge of Dreamy Room Level 29.</li>
        <li><strong>Save Progress Frequently:</strong> Save your progress after major placements so you can easily correct any mistakes without losing time.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use the Grid:</strong> Activate grid or alignment features to help position furniture more precisely.</li>
        <li><strong>Start from the Top:</strong> Place the upper-floor items first, then arrange the lower floor to complement them.</li>
        <li><strong>Group Similar Items:</strong> Keep similar items together, especially in the kitchen, to avoid clutter and maintain a cohesive look.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment Before Finalizing:</strong> Don’t hesitate to move items around until you find the perfect layout that suits you.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following these steps, you’ll successfully transform the empty space into a cozy pastel-themed two-story haven in Dreamy Room Level 29. Enjoy the process and have fun decorating!</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 30 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 30! In this level, your goal is to transform a plain mint-green corner into a tranquil nook complete with comfy seating, lush greenery, and a delightful tea party setup. Pay close attention to the precise placement of each item, as this is key to achieving a harmonious and cozy final result.</p>
  
      <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>
  
      <h4>Step 1: Position the Main Floor and Small Tile</h4>
      <p>Start by placing the large mint-green floor piece and the smaller matching tile. Align them precisely so the corner cutout is at the bottom-right. This serves as the base for your setup.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 2: Install the Glass Barrier</h4>
      <p>Attach the transparent glass railing around the outer edges of the floor. This will create an airy, defined space and set the tone for a tranquil environment.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 3: Place the Sofa Under the Window</h4>
      <p>Move the comfy sofa to the left wall, directly beneath the window. Make sure it’s snug against the corner to balance the room's layout.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 4: Add Cushions and a Cozy Blanket</h4>
      <p>Place a large cushion on the sofa and drape a soft blanket across one side. These simple touches make the space inviting and warm.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 5: Position the Large Monstera Plant</h4>
      <p>In the corner between the window and sofa, position the tall monstera plant. Its lush green leaves will give the space a refreshing, natural vibe.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 6: Hang the Two Planters</h4>
      <p>Attach the two hanging planters from the top of the window frame. Ensure they are evenly spaced to achieve a balanced, aesthetically pleasing look.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 7: Set Up the Ladder Shelf and Flower Pots</h4>
      <p>On the right side of the floor, place the wooden ladder shelf. Arrange flower pots on its steps to add vibrant colors and enhance the gardening theme.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 8: Arrange the Table, Teapot, and Treats</h4>
      <p>Position the small round table with a green-and-white checkered tablecloth in the center. Place the teapot, two teacups, a slice of cake, and some pastries on top. This tea setup is a focal point of the room, so make sure it’s centered for maximum impact.</p>
  
      <h4>Step 9: Seat the Cat on the Chair</h4>
      <p>Finally, place a wooden chair to the right of the table and let the cat settle on the seat. This finishing touch brings the tranquil nook to life and captures the cozy, relaxed atmosphere.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Precision is Key:</strong> Make sure each object is placed in its correct spot before moving on. Misplaced items may prevent other objects from locking into place.</li>
        <li><strong>Glass Barrier Placement:</strong> Be careful when placing the glass barrier; misalignment could block other placements.</li>
        <li><strong>Cat Placement:</strong> The cat can only sit on the chair once the table setup is complete. Placing the cat too early may prevent the completion indicator from triggering.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rotate Objects:</strong> Rotate furniture slowly to ensure it fits perfectly in the available space.</li>
        <li><strong>Start with Large Items:</strong> Begin with larger items like the sofa and glass barrier to outline your space. Smaller pieces can then be added around them.</li>
        <li><strong>Use the Window Area for Greenery:</strong> The window provides natural light, so it’s a perfect spot for your plants. Position them here to create a realistic and visually appealing setup.</li>
        <li><strong>Match Color Palettes:</strong> When placing items like the checkered table and cushions, make sure they complement each other for a cohesive design.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following these detailed instructions, you'll complete Dreamy Room Level 30 and create a serene, tranquil nook with lush plants, a delightful tea table, and a contented cat. Enjoy the decorating process and the peaceful space you've created!</p>
