    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 84: Serene Japanese Spa Haven</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 84! In this level, you'll be transforming a blank space into a serene Japanese spa haven. Follow these steps to perfect your layout and create a peaceful, calming atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Circular Stone Floor Slab in the Center</h3>
    <p>Start by selecting the light-grey, patterned circular stone tile and snapping it into the exact center of your grid. This forms the base for the entire spa layout.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Surround with Outer Grey Stone Wall Segments</h3>
    <p>Place the large curved grey rock-wall pieces around the edge of the circular floor. Ensure the pieces form a complete ring, defining the pool boundary.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fill the Interior with Water</h3>
    <p>Select the calm blue water fill and drag it into the space inside the stone ring. It should snap to cover the inner circle without spilling over.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Inner Decorative Stone Ring</h3>
    <p>Use smaller curved stone segments to create a second, inner stone ring just above the water, creating a layered spiral effect at the center of your pool.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Position the Wooden Hot Tub Barrel at Top-Left</h3>
    <p>Place the large wooden barrel with metal bands at the top-left side of the pool, partially in the water and partially over the inner stone ring. Ensure the small wooden step-ladder faces outward.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Place the Stone Fountain Statue Behind the Barrel</h3>
    <p>Position the carved stone statue (with water flowing from its mouth) directly behind the barrel, and rotate it so the stream flows into the pool.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Add Bamboo Stalks Behind the Statue</h3>
    <p>Tuck several green bamboo stalks behind the fountain statue, creating height and a natural look in the background.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Construct the Corner Pavilion Frame in the Top-Right</h3>
    <p>Place two dark wooden vertical posts into the top-right corner. Connect them with the grey bamboo crossbar roof piece to create an L-shaped open pavilion.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Snap in the L-Shaped Bench and Shoji Screens</h3>
    <p>Place the wooden L-shaped bench inside the pavilion frame. Add the sliding white paper shoji panels on the open sides, and attach the red fabric valance at the top.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Add Red Floor Cushions and Beige Towel Stack</h3>
    <p>Place two round red seat cushions onto the bench, spacing them evenly. Add a small stack of beige towels at the inner corner of the bench.</p>

    <h3>Step 11: Place Flat Circular Stepping Stones at the Pavilion Entrance</h3>
    <p>Drop two flat grey stepping stones outside the pavilion, along the water’s edge, creating a clean path to the seating area.</p>

    <h3>Step 12: Build the Sushi-Stall / Torii Gate at Bottom-Right</h3>
    <p>Place two wooden posts at the bottom-right stone ring and connect them with a grey bamboo crossbar. Add red hanging banners and rope tassels to complete the sushi-stall look.</p>

    <h3>Step 13: Arrange Sushi Platter Items and Slippers</h3>
    <p>Place the round wooden tray with sushi rolls and a cup atop the stone edge next to the stall. Add the pair of green-and-beige swirl sandals just to the right.</p>

    <h3>Step 14: Set the Side Table with Towels, Bottles, and Plant</h3>
    <p>Choose the small circular wooden table and place it at the bottom-left. Add the rolled white towel, two pastel soap bottles, a brush, and a potted green plant on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 15: Add the Miniature Footbridge, Stone Lantern, Shrub, and Extra Stones</h3>
    <p>Position the curved wooden footbridge to the left of the barrel. Place the mini stone lantern in front of the bridge and a small green shrub beside it. Add two more flat stepping stones around the area.</p>

    <h3>Step 16: Hang Paper Lanterns from Both Structures</h3>
    <p>Finally, hang one yellow paper lantern from the torii gate’s crossbar and another from the side post of the pavilion. This completes the serene ambiance of your spa haven.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precision:</strong> Getting each piece perfectly aligned is crucial—reset and try again if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlapping Items:</strong> Watch for auto-layering with pieces like the barrel and inner stones.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> Carefully rotate corner benches and bridge rails to avoid blocking snap points.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grid Snapping:</strong> Enable the “show grid” option to view snap points before placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Quick Rotate:</strong> Tap an object to rotate it in 45° increments, essential for aligning the shoji screens.</li>
      <li><strong>Mirror Placement:</strong> Place one side of the torii gate, then mirror it for perfect symmetry.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer Locking:</strong> Lock background elements (like the floor and stone ring) to avoid accidental shifts during detailed placements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 85: Elegant Garden Retreat</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 85! In this level, you’ll transform a two-story space into an elegant garden retreat. Follow these steps to arrange each item for the perfect cozy and refined atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Arrange the Pastel Seating Set Upstairs</h3>
    <p>Start by placing the seven pastel-framed chairs on the upper floor. Line up four chairs flush against the back wall (mint, lemon, peach, rose) and three along the left wall (mint, lemon, peach). Ensure that each chair is matched with a wooden chest positioned directly in front of it, with the chest legs aligned with the chair legs.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Hang the Vine-Draped Beam with Birds</h3>
    <p>Install the long wooden beam across the ceiling of the upper room. Drape the teal vine over the beam so it cascades on either side. Position the three yellow bird figurines evenly along the top of the beam: one at each end and one in the center.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Place the Bucket of Linens</h3>
    <p>On the right side of the seating area, place the small wooden bucket filled with rolled pastel linens against the wall. Position it flush with the chair at the end of the row.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Corner Side Table with Crystals and Candles</h3>
    <p>At the corner where the back and left seating meet, place the low mahogany side table. On top, arrange a golden candelabra and a purple crystal cluster so they face the center of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Install the Wall Shelf and Mugs Above the Window</h3>
    <p>Mount the small curved shelf just above the window frame on the right wall. Position two ceramic mugs (pink on the left, yellow on the right) and two hardcover books (green, then blue) on the shelf.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Set the Arched Window and Crow</h3>
    <p>Embed the arched wooden window into the right-hand wall opening. Then place the crow figurine on the sill, facing inward toward the dining area.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Arrange the Under-Window Side Table</h3>
    <p>Beneath the window, position the round wooden side table. On top, place a red apple, a blue jar, a green jar, and the mortar and pestle, neatly spaced.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Place the Central Staircase</h3>
    <p>Center the pink-and-cream staircase so that its top step aligns with the upper floor and its bottom step connects cleanly to the lower level.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Position the Fireplace</h3>
    <p>Against the right interior wall, just below the railing, install the cream-and-pink fireplace, ensuring the chimney stack lines up with the ceiling.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Add the Companion Side Table Next to the Fireplace</h3>
    <p>To the left of the fireplace, place the square wooden table. Top it with a golden lamp and a small stack of glowing crystals.</p>

    <h3>Step 11: Place the Potted Plant by the Stairs</h3>
    <p>At the base of the staircase on the lower floor, add the medium-sized green potted plant to the left side of the steps.</p>

    <h3>Step 12: Arrange the Dining Table and Golden Chairs</h3>
    <p>On the lower floor, position the long rectangular table (with a white cloth and pink trim) between the two pillars. Surround it with six golden chairs—three on each side—with the chair backs facing outward.</p>

    <h3>Step 13: Add the Pumpkin Centerpiece and Florals</h3>
    <p>Center a small pumpkin on the dining table. Flank it with two flower vases (pink blooms) and place two tiny candleholders on either side of the pumpkin.</p>

    <h3>Step 14: Set the Watering Can and Trowel</h3>
    <p>To the left of the dining table’s leg, place the green watering can and the hand trowel, with their handles pointing toward the railing.</p>

    <h3>Step 15: Drape the Exterior Vine on the Porch Beam</h3>
    <p>Outside the upper right archway, attach the curved wooden beam and drape the white-flowered teal vine so it wraps around the arch.</p>

    <h3>Step 16: Position the Bench and Flower Pot on the Porch</h3>
    <p>Under the vine-covered beam, place the cushioned bench against the left porch wall. Above the bench, nestle the red flower pot in the built-in railing planter.</p>

    <h3>Step 17: Add the Red-Flowered Bucket by the Entry</h3>
    <p>On the porch floor to the left of the stairs, set the wooden bucket filled with red blossoms.</p>

    <h3>Step 18: Place the Golden Crystal on Its Pedestal</h3>
    <p>At the lower right corner of the porch, rest the golden crystal cluster atop the square stone pedestal. Lean the hammer and pickaxe against its side.</p>

    <h3>Step 19: Set the Panda Figurine by the Hearth</h3>
    <p>Finally, on the hearth next to the fireplace, position the panda plush figurine facing toward the room for a heartwarming touch.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grid Snapping:</strong> Misaligned placement may block future objects, as each item snaps to a hidden grid.</li>
      <li><strong>No Rotation:</strong> Objects cannot be rotated. Place carefully in their fixed orientations.</li>
      <li><strong>Single-Drag Limit:</strong> Only one item can be dragged at a time, so plan your sequence to avoid backtracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlap Warnings:</strong> If two objects occupy the same grid cell, one will disappear until adjusted.</li>
      <li><strong>No Timer:</strong> There is no timer, so take your time to arrange each piece accurately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Work Outside-In:</strong> Begin with large furniture (staircase, fireplace, table) and then add decor.</li>
      <li><strong>Use the Overlay:</strong> Toggle the transparent placement preview to check for overlaps before placing items.</li>
      <li><strong>Undo Is Your Friend:</strong> Quickly use the undo button if you misplace an item, instead of manually repositioning.</li>
      <li><strong>Sectional Completion:</strong> Finish one floor at a time to keep track of the remaining objects.</li>
      <li><strong>Save Often:</strong> If possible, save your progress after each major section to prevent losing work.</li>
      <li><strong>Ambient Focus:</strong> Play with music off or use headphones to concentrate on spatial arrangements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With these detailed steps and helpful tips, you’ll be able to complete Dreamy Room Level 85 and create your elegant garden retreat. Enjoy your cozy space and happy decorating!</p>

        <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 86: Cozy Pastel Diorama</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 86! This level challenges you to transform an empty circular platform into a cozy, pastel-perfect diorama filled with cherished objects. Follow these detailed steps to complete your design and reveal the hidden life story behind each placement.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Place the Crescent Canopy Arch in the Back Center</h3>
        <p>Start by positioning the large white crescent-shaped canopy arch against the back half of the platform. Align its base with the circular edge so the cutout stars face forward.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Place the Large Yellow Orb and Its White Ring Under the Canopy</h3>
        <p>Hang the bright yellow celestial orb just below the peak of the canopy. Fit its thin white ring snugly around its equator for a dreamy mobile effect.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Place the Golden Diamond Ornaments in a Cluster Beside the Orb</h3>
        <p>Attach the five faceted golden diamond pendants to the canopy ceiling. Group them to the right of the orb, varying their heights for a whimsical touch.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Place the Curved Pink Sectional Sofa Against the Back Wall</h3>
        <p>Slide the coral-pink curved sofa flush against the inside rim of the canopy’s back wall. Center it beneath the orb and diamonds for a balanced layout.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Place the Pink Cushion on the Center of the Sofa</h3>
        <p>Place a soft pink throw pillow in the middle of the sofa to add a cozy and inviting element to the space.</p>

        <h3>Step 6: Place the Wooden Floor Lamp to the Left of the Sofa</h3>
        <p>Position the tall lamp with a beige lampshade immediately to the left of the sofa, nestled between the sofa and the record console.</p>

        <h3>Step 7: Place the Record Player Console on the Left Platform</h3>
        <p>Place the multi-tiered record player console on the left side of the platform, directly under the canopy. Make sure the turntable faces outward for easy access.</p>

        <h3>Step 8: Place the Egg-Shaped Lamp on the Console’s Lower Level</h3>
        <p>Set the pastel orange egg lamp on the lower shelf of the console, directly below the record player.</p>

        <h3>Step 9: Place the Curved Back Bookshelf Behind the Sofa</h3>
        <p>Slot the semicircular bookshelf flush against the back interior of the canopy, directly behind the sofa. Fill the shelves with books and rolled blankets for added texture.</p>

        <h3>Step 10: Place the Tall Bookshelf Tower on the Far Right</h3>
        <p>Anchor the vertical bookcase at the right edge of the canopy’s interior, ensuring the pastel boxes and books face inward.</p>

        <h3>Step 11: Place the Three Framed Art Pieces on the Right Wall</h3>
        <p>Hang the three square frames in a vertical cluster on the right wall, between the curved bookshelf and the tall bookshelf tower.</p>

        <h3>Step 12: Place the Round Side Table with the Star-Flower Vase Next to the Sofa</h3>
        <p>Place a small round side table to the right of the sofa. On top, arrange the blue vase with three white star-tipped flowers for a delicate touch.</p>

        <h3>Step 13: Place the Side Table with the Small Lamp Near the Bookshelf</h3>
        <p>Position the second round side table just in front of the tall bookshelf tower. Set the tiny beige lamp on top for soft lighting.</p>

        <h3>Step 14: Place the Rectangular Desk at the Front Center</h3>
        <p>Center the rosy-red desk with white legs at the front of the platform, ensuring it’s aligned with the sofa for a harmonious look.</p>

        <h3>Step 15: Place the Green Desk Lamp on the Left Corner of the Desk</h3>
        <p>Place the adjustable green lamp at the top-left corner of the desk for optimal lighting while working or reading.</p>

        <h3>Step 16: Place the Open Notebook and Pen in the Center of the Desk</h3>
        <p>Spread an open lined notebook at the center of the desk, and place the pen across its pages for an inviting workspace vibe.</p>

        <h3>Step 17: Place the Yellow Rotary Phone on the Right Side of the Desk</h3>
        <p>Position the vintage yellow rotary phone at the desk’s right corner, adding a retro touch to the design.</p>

        <h3>Step 18: Place the Three Pastel Alphabet Cubes Directly Behind the Desk</h3>
        <p>Arrange the pink, mint, and blue alphabet blocks just behind the desk, partially resting on the green circle of the floor for an added playful element.</p>

        <h3>Step 19: Place the Teal Scroll Vase at the Front-Left of the Desk</h3>
        <p>Set the ceramic teal scroll vase filled with rolled plans or scrolls on the floor to the left of the desk legs, adding an organized yet decorative element.</p>

        <h3>Step 20: Place the Telescope on Its Tripod at the Front-Left Edge</h3>
        <p>Position the lavender telescope on its wooden tripod at the platform’s left edge, angled toward the center for a serene exploration vibe.</p>

        <h3>Step 21: Place the Globe on Its Pedestal Table at the Front-Right</h3>
        <p>Place the blue-green globe on its small round pedestal table at the front-right of the platform, complementing the desk setup.</p>

        <h3>Step 22: Place the Potted Plant on a Wooden Stool at the Front-Right</h3>
        <p>Finally, position the leafy green plant in its purple pot atop the three-legged wooden stool just beyond the globe, completing the peaceful diorama.</p>

        <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Avoid Overlapping:</strong> Ensure no two objects share the same footprint to prevent blocking placement.</li>
          <li><strong>Snap-to-Grid Feature:</strong> Use the snap guides for perfect alignment, especially for the canopy and desk.</li>
          <li><strong>Layer Order Matters:</strong> Place large background elements first, then add foreground pieces to prevent blocking.</li>
          <li><strong>Rotation Lock:</strong> Engage the rotation lock for circular items like the orb and globe to prevent drift.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Batch Placement:</strong> Group similar objects (e.g., tabletop items) for faster placement.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Zoom:</strong> Zoom in for precise placement, especially for small items like the diamonds and orb.</li>
          <li><strong>Color Cues:</strong> Hover over items to see color outlines indicating where they snap into place.</li>
          <li><strong>Undo Freely:</strong> Don’t hesitate to undo and try new arrangements as you explore your options.</li>
          <li><strong>Visit Gallery:</strong> Preview unlocked decor in the gallery to help plan where items should go.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Follow these steps to complete Dreamy Room Level 86, and you’ll have a cozy pastel diorama that’sperfect for unwinding after a long day.</p>

    <p>Place the small tray holding two sushi pieces just outside the cat zone.</p>

    <h3>Step 28: Place the Small Round Wooden Stool to the Left of the DJ Station</h3>
    <p>Slide the single-leg stool under the platform’s front edge, next to the white arch.</p>

    <h3>Step 29: Place the Black Coffee Table with Papers and Pencil Holder in the Floor Rug Center</h3>
    <p>Set the low circular table on the blue rug and arrange the scattered sheets and pencil pot on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 30: Place the Heart Beanbags and Daisy Cushion Around the Coffee Table</h3>
    <p>Arrange the two heart-shaped beanbags (brown and cream) and the daisy-shaped floor cushion around the table.</p>

    <h3>Step 31: Place the Teddy Bear Plush and Orange Cushion to the Right of the Coffee Table</h3>
    <p>Position the beige teddy and the orange cushion side by side on the rug’s right edge to finish the cozy corner.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Timer:</strong> Take your time to match placements exactly, as there is no countdown.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer Ordering:</strong> Always drop background wall items before adding props in front to avoid occlusion mistakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Snap Zones:</strong> Use the game’s subtle snap guides to ensure alignment for perfect placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlap:</strong> Watch for overlaps, especially on the platform border—ensure props are fully within the platform.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 88: Cozy Autumn Kitchen</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 88! Your mission is to transform a pumpkin-shaped room into a cozy, autumn-inspired kitchen. This guide will walk you through every step to ensure you place each item perfectly for a warm and inviting kitchen atmosphere.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Place the Wooden Rolling Pin on the Left Wall Hooks</h3>
        <p>Start by mounting the wooden rolling pin, which features pumpkin-shaped handles, onto the two green hooks centered on the left wall. This adds a decorative and autumnal touch to your kitchen.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Add the Tall Wooden Bookshelf and Populate Its Shelves</h3>
        <p>Position the three-shelf wooden bookshelf against the left wall floor. Then, populate the shelves as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Top shelf:</strong> Place the little orange pumpkin-shaped bag.</li>
            <li><strong>Middle shelf:</strong> Arrange the vintage purple camera on the left and the green leaf-style table lamp on the right.</li>
            <li><strong>Bottom shelf:</strong> Line up the three green-spined books neatly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Lay the Checkered Rug and Position the Pumpkin Coffee Table</h3>
        <p>Place the circular gray-and-white checkered rug in the center of the floor. Then, position the pumpkin-shaped coffee table directly on top of the rug to anchor the cozy seating area.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Decorate the Coffee Table Surface</h3>
        <p>On the coffee table, add the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place a miniature pumpkin decoration on the left segment.</li>
            <li>Set a bowl of mixed fruit (grapes, berries) on the back segment.</li>
            <li>Place a pink-frosted pastry cake on the right segment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 5: Position the Planter Box with Mushroom</h3>
        <p>Alongside the coffee table, place the small rectangular planter box containing the blue-and-red mushroom on the floor to the right of the rug.</p>

        <h3>Step 6: Add the Bread Basket Stool</h3>
        <p>Move the wooden bar stool to the left of the counter and place the wicker basket with the braided loaf of bread on top.</p>

        <h3>Step 7: Install the Window and Pink Curtains</h3>
        <p>Mount the round-pane window on the left wall. Drape the ruffled pink curtains on either side, securing them with the little pumpkin tie-backs.</p>

        <h3>Step 8: Mount the Corner L-Shaped Shelf and Arrange Tableware</h3>
        <p>In the back-left corner of the room, attach the wooden L-shaped shelf. Then, place the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two bottles (one purple, one amber)</li>
            <li>One wooden serving bowl</li>
            <li>A stack of plates</li>
            <li>A white coffee mug</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 9: Hang Wall Clock, Heart Lamp, and Mirror</h3>
        <p>Above the corner shelf, install the following items from left to right:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The vintage purple wall clock</li>
            <li>The dangling heart-shaped bulb lamp</li>
            <li>The small oval mirror with a blue frame</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 10: Add Floating Succulent Shelf and Right-Wall Sconce</h3>
        <p>On the right wall, mount the small wooden shelf and place the potted succulent on it. Just below, install the single-bulb wall sconce with a green base.</p>

        <h3>Step 11: Place the Pastel Purple Fridge and Decorate It</h3>
        <p>Slide the pale purple double-door fridge flush against the right wall. Decorate the fridge with a ghost doodle sticky note and a checklist note on its front. Drape the trailing succulent vine over the top edge.</p>

        <h3>Step 12: Set the Green Bin Next to the Fridge</h3>
        <p>Place the small round green bin directly to the right of the fridge, completing the right-wall grouping.</p>

        <h3>Step 13: Install the Kitchen Counter Along Back and Right Walls</h3>
        <p>Snap the brown countertop pieces into place around the back-left corner and along the right wall, creating a continuous work surface for your kitchen.</p>

        <h3>Step 14: Attach Knife Rack, Hang Garlic, and Ghost Bag</h3>
        <p>On the back wall above the counter, mount the purple magnetic rail with three knives. Hang the bundle of garlic bulbs and the little purple tote bag with the ghost print side by side.</p>

        <h3>Step 15: Place the Sink, Faucet, and Hose</h3>
        <p>Slot the rectangular sink into the countertop near the center of the back wall. Attach the green swan-neck faucet and coil the matching green hose around its base.</p>

        <h3>Step 16: Add the Cutting Board with Sliced Bread</h3>
        <p>To the left of the sink, lay down the wooden cutting board and arrange the sliced bread pieces on top.</p>

        <h3>Step 17: Install Under-Counter Drawers, Pot, and Strawberries</h3>
        <p>Under the countertop, click in the three pastel drawers (purple under the stove, yellow under the sink, and pink under the pot area). Then place the brown soup pot with bubbling green stew on the right burner and scatter two red strawberries beside it.</p>

        <h3>Step 18: Final Placement Check</h3>
        <p>Walk through the room and ensure that every item matches the completed image’s locations. The key challenge is precision, so double-check alignments and spacing for the perfect cozy kitchen.</p>

        <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Timer:</strong> Dreamy Room Level 88 is untimed, so focus on accuracy over speed.</li>
          <li><strong>Snap-to-Grid:</strong> Objects will “snap” into preset slots. If an item won’t attach, try nudging it slightly.</li>
          <li><strong>Overlap Issues:</strong> Some items may collide if placed too close—use the drag tool to adjust.</li>
          <li><strong>Undo Button:</strong> You can always undo a placement if an object lands incorrectly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Batch Placement:</strong> Group similar items together for faster placement.</li>
          <li><strong>Zoom In:</strong> Zoom in to ensure precise placement, especially for smaller items.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Snap Guides:</strong> Align large items first, like the countertop and fridge, then focus on smaller decor.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Follow these steps to successfully complete Dreamy Room Level 88 and enjoy your cozy autumn kitchen!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 89: Charming Winter Wonderland</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 89! In this level, you'll need to create a futuristic workshop complete with robots, tech gadgets, and minimalistic furnishings. Follow these steps carefully to get everything in place.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Empty Room Shell</h3>
    <p>Start by placing the empty pastel-blue floor panel and three adjoining walls in the center of the workspace. Ensure the beveled edges of the walls meet perfectly at the corners, creating a hollow isometric room shape.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Vent Unit and Pipes</h3>
    <p>Snap the rectangular vent unit into place at the top-center of the back wall. Make sure it aligns with the beveled edge of the wall, ensuring the fan grills and curved piping face outward.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Blueprint Poster</h3>
    <p>Place the semi-transparent blueprint poster just below the vent unit, to the right. This will serve as a decorative piece in the center of the room, just above where the bed will go later.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Mount the Glass Display Shelves</h3>
    <p>Click the modular shelving unit into the back-left wall. Fill the cubbies with colorful beakers, test tubes, and flasks to complete the laboratory look.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Decorate the Shelves with Robot Figurines</h3>
    <p>Place three small robot figurines on the top shelf. Arrange a pink-and-white spotted model, a purple orb-shaped bot, and a green snail-styled toy evenly along the shelf.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Position the Sci-Fi Door</h3>
    <p>Install the sci-fi door frame along the left wall. The triangular handle side should face inward, flush against the lower-left corner of the wall.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Add the Sink and Faucet</h3>
    <p>Place the rectangular sink basin and curved faucet to the right of the door, ensuring one grid unit of space to the right side for movement.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Attach the Tool Rack</h3>
    <p>Install the gray tool rack next to the sink. Hang the hammer, wrench, and pliers on their designated hooks.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Place the Scrap Metal Bin</h3>
    <p>Position the green recycling bin beneath the tool rack, ensuring it aligns with the tools above.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Position the Dual Robotic Arms</h3>
    <p>Move the dual robotic arm assembly to the front-left corner, one grid unit away from the left wall. Ensure the arms are angled towards the center of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 11: Place the Workbench in the Center</h3>
    <p>Drag the hexagonal blue worktable into the center of the room. Use the grid overlay to ensure it is perfectly centered both horizontally and vertically.</p>

    <h3>Step 12: Add Items to the Workbench</h3>
    <p>Place the prototype robot in the center of the table. Arrange the smartphone stand, oversized wrench, holographic display, oil can, and crown gadget around the prototype bot for a futuristic touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 13: Position the Bed and Side Chair</h3>
    <p>Place the mint-green bed frame in the back-right corner of the room. Position the teal side chair just outside the bed’s rail on its right side.</p>

    <h3>Step 14: Add the Computer Desk and Monitor</h3>
    <p>Snap the turquoise desk flush against the right wall. Add the widescreen monitor above, slide the keyboard directly beneath it, and position the purple-topped control console on the left side of the desk.</p>

    <h3>Step 15: Add the Petri Dish Incubator</h3>
    <p>Place the tall glass dome incubator on the desk, near the chair’s armrest. The glowing green sprout inside gives the room a high-tech vibe.</p>

    <h3>Step 16: Add the Mini Shelf</h3>
    <p>Position the three-tiered mini shelf to the right of the desk. Stack colorful books on the lower tiers and place a leafy potted plant on the top shelf.</p>

    <h3>Step 17: Add Cooler Boxes</h3>
    <p>Place the grey and pink cooler boxes side by side on the floor near the desk, completing the futuristic look of the room.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Snap-to-Grid:</strong> Objects will snap into preset slots. Be cautious of any misalignments.</li>
      <li><strong>Space Considerations:</strong> Make sure there is enough space between items to avoid overlap.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Follow these steps carefully, and you'll have completed Dreamy Room Level 89 with a futuristic workshop theme.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 89: Cozy Sushi Café</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 90! In this level, you'll create a charming, cozy sushi café. From setting up the wooden floors to arranging the sushi bar and seating, follow these steps carefully to create your perfect sushi spot.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Wooden Floor Panel</h3>
    <p>Start by dragging the large wooden floor tile into the center of the workspace. This will serve as the foundation for your café in Dreamy Room Level 90.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Attach the Back Wall</h3>
    <p>Pick the tall cream-colored back wall and snap it into the rear edge of the floor panel. This wall will support the roof and decorations.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Left Side Wall</h3>
    <p>Place the shorter side wall with pink-trimmed corners along the left side of the floor panel. Ensure the edges align perfectly to form a seamless corner.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Install the Right Railing</h3>
    <p>Place the wooden railing along the right open edge of the floor, defining the café's outdoor seating area.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Mount the Rooftop Base</h3>
    <p>Place the dark grey roof slab atop the two walls. This roof will cover the sushi preparation area.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Drape the Greenery on the Roof</h3>
    <p>Lay the vine of green leaves with white flowers along the front edge of the roof. This will add a cozy, natural touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Hang the Noren Curtains</h3>
    <p>Attach the pink-patterned curtain strips under the roof overhang. These curtains will mark the entrance to the kitchen.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Add the Koi Fish Decorations</h3>
    <p>Place the colorful koi fish decals around the roof corners. Place three fish on each side to complete the rooftop theme.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Position the Sushi Counter</h3>
    <p>Drag the long wooden sushi counter onto the floor against the back wall. This counter will serve as the main sushi bar.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Seat the Sushi Chef Cat</h3>
    <p>Position the pink-cheeked cat chef behind the counter. The chef will prepare all the sushi orders here.</p>

    <h3>Step 11: Add Sushi Prep Items</h3>
    <p>Place the rice bowl, nori sheet on a wooden board, sliced salmon, and pre-rolled maki beside the chef to create the busy kitchen atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 12: Stack the Black Plates and Utensils</h3>
    <p>Place the stack of black plates on the far left of the counter, then position the chopstick holder next to them.</p>

    <h3>Step 13: Install the “SUSHI” Sign</h3>
    <p>Attach the bold yellow “SUSHI” letters to the front of the counter. Place sliced sushi roll pillars on either side of the sign.</p>

    <h3>Step 14: Place the Glass Display Case</h3>
    <p>Snap the refrigerated display case onto the left end of the counter to display fresh sushi and pastries.</p>

    <h3>Step 15: Add the Cash Register and Loaves</h3>
    <p>Position the POS terminal next to the display case, then place the two bread loaves beside it.</p>

    <h3>Step 16: Mount the Calendar and Lanterns</h3>
    <p>Hang the “24” desk calendar behind the counter, then place red cylindrical lanterns on either side of the entryway to complete the interior look.</p>

    <h3>Step 17: Arrange the Patio Tables and Chairs</h3>
    <p>Place the small wooden patio table and two chairs in the front area, then add a row of three bar stools along the counter’s exterior.</p>

    <h3>Step 18: Seat Your Cat Customers</h3>
    <p>Position the white and brown cat figures at the patio table and the grey cat on the rightmost bar stool. These customers will add charm to the scene.</p>

    <h3>Step 19: Install the Side Oven and Plant</h3>
    <p>Place the stone oven with a baked fish dish into the niche of the right wall, then add the leafy potted plant beside it.</p>

    <h3>Step 20: Place the Entrance A-Board Sign</h3>
    <p>Finally, position the wooden A-frame chalkboard sign near the front steps to announce the café’s grand opening.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Walls and floors must snap into place precisely. Misaligned pieces can block object placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer Order:</strong> Start with the base elements (floor, walls, railing) before adding decorations to avoid occlusion.</li>
      <li><strong>Object Rotation:</strong> Some items may require rotation. Rotate them 90° if they don’t fit at first.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlap Prevention:</strong> Ensure the koi fish and greenery do not overlap during placement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Follow these steps to create the perfect cozy sushi café in Dreamy Room Level 90!</p>
