    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 101: Desert Restaurant</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 101 challenges you to build a desert-themed restaurant with Egyptian-inspired decor. Follow this step-by-step guide to ensure each item is placed perfectly.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 1: Place the Two Palm Trees on the Platform Edges</h3>
    <p>Start by placing the two palm trees on the southwest and northeast edges of the platform. Ensure they align with the platform's subtle contours for a balanced look.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 2: Place the Cluster of Cacti Around the Island’s Perimeter</h3>
    <p>Position the cacti around the platform, alternating between tall and short ones to create a natural, whimsical edge. Rotate each cactus to align with the notches for proper placement.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 3: Place the Pyramid Roof Centrally on the Base Pad</h3>
    <p>Center the large pyramid roof over the middle of the platform. Align it with the base, ensuring the peak faces forward for a perfect fit.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 4: Place the Glass Window Facade on the West Wall</h3>
    <p>Mount the tall green-tinted window on the left side of the pyramid's base. The window's frame should snap into the notch precisely. Make sure it faces inward at a right angle.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 5: Place the Restaurant Sign and Utensil Emblem Above the Entrance</h3>
    <p>Install the circular white disc sign above the counter opening. Attach the "Restaurant" plaque below it, rotating the text slightly to match the reference image.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 6: Place the Egyptian-Style Pillars at the Front Corners of the Counter</h3>
    <p>Position the ornate yellow and pink pillars at the left and right sides of the counter, ensuring they face inward with the lotus capitals aligned properly.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 7: Place the Red-and-White Counter Unit, Yellow Bar Stools, and Three Countertop Items</h3>
    <p>Place the red-and-white counter in the center front notch. Position the yellow bar stools beneath the counter and arrange the coffee cup, burger plate, and orange juice tumbler on top.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 8: Place the Round Patio Table and Four Chairs on the Front-Left Terrace</h3>
    <p>Place the round table on the front-left terrace, followed by the four red chairs arranged around it. Two chairs should face inward and two outward for balanced seating.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 9: Position the Staircase, Vending Machine, Mummy Figurine, and Fruit Crate</h3>
    <p>On the east side, install the staircase, followed by the vending machine. Add the mummy figurine on the landing and the wooden fruit crate with green melons nearby.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 10: Place the Black-and-Yellow Sphinx Ornament in the Center of the Pyramid Roof</h3>
    <p>Finally, place the black-and-yellow sphinx ornament at the top of the pyramid roof. Ensure it aligns with the notch and locks into place for a dramatic finish.</p>
  
    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Snap-Point Sensitivity:</strong> Be mindful of misalignments. Rotate items slightly if they won’t lock into place.</li>
      <li><strong>Orientation:</strong> Some items, like the Egyptian pillars and sphinx, need to face specific directions. Always check the highlighted outline before placing.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera Angles:</strong> Rotate and zoom as needed to get the best view of the notches and make precise placements.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use the Snap Sound:</strong> Trust the snap sound when an object locks into place—it’s your best indicator of correct placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Take Your Time:</strong> Level 101 is challenging, so don’t rush. Double-check placements for accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>By following this guide, you’ll create a stunning desert restaurant with perfect precision. Enjoy the process and complete Dreamy Room Level 101 with ease!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 102: Spa-Themed Room</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 102 challenges you to create a serene and stylish spa-inspired room with a variety of decorative items. Follow this detailed guide to arrange everything with precision and finesse.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the two cream-colored mattresses on the top platform</h3>
    <p>Begin by placing the two scalloped-edge, cream-colored mattresses side by side on the raised platform at the back of the room. Ensure they are flush against the curved back wall—position the left mattress just to the left of center and the right mattress to the right. This precise placement is crucial for later object alignment.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the plush bunny toys and draped blanket</h3>
    <p>Place the grey bunny plush on the left mattress, facing inward toward the room. On the right mattress, position the yellow bunny plush upright with its feet hanging over the edge. Add the lavender-toned throw blanket across the foot of the right mattress, ensuring it drapes naturally.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mount the floating towel shelf and dual hair dryers</h3>
    <p>Mount the slender wooden floating shelf just below the arch in the back wall, positioning it between the two hair dryer hooks. Place the stacks of folded towels on the shelf, arranged in pastel colors from left to right. Add the pastel purple hair dryers above the left and right mattresses.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Arrange bottles, rolled towels, and pineapple on the glass railing</h3>
    <p>Populate the transparent glass railing with four pastel bottles, aligning them in a straight line along the center. On the left, arrange three rolled towels, and on the far right, place a decorative pineapple sculpture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Build and position the red staircase to the upper level</h3>
    <p>Drag the five pastel red steps and position them on the lower right wall, ensuring they align flush with the lower floor and the top platform.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Construct the shower cubicle and arched shelving unit</h3>
    <p>Create a U-shaped shower cubicle with three panel privacy walls in the lower-left corner. Add the chrome shower fixture inside the cubicle and a green floor mat. Position the arch-topped shelving unit outside the cubicle and fill it with colorful bath bottles and bath balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Hang the shower curtain and decorative floral wreath</h3>
    <p>Install the metal curtain rod across the shower opening and slide the beige curtain onto the rod. Add the floral wreath to the center hook of the curtain rod for a charming accent.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Install the clothing rack, hang garments, and position the towel rack</h3>
    <p>Place the horizontal clothing rod between the shower cubicle and seating area. Hang four pastel jackets from left to right in color order, then place a wooden towel rack in front with neatly arranged towels.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Set up the cozy seating nook with table, chairs, and planter box</h3>
    <p>Place the round wooden table at the center of the lower floor. Arrange the two peach chairs facing each other around the table. Add a pink teapot, teacup, and dessert plate with a pastry. Finally, line up the rectangular planter box with lush green foliage along the front edge of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Add lockers and top-mounted potted plants for storage flair</h3>
    <p>Align four pastel blue lockers side by side along the right lower wall, then stack a fifth locker on top to create a locker column. Top it with a leafy potted plant, and add smaller plants on the adjacent lockers.</p>

    <h3>Step 11: Build the spa tub, place bath accessories, and floating shelves</h3>
    <p>Place the blue rectangular tub on the lower right platform and fill it with water. Add a sheep plush and a rubber duck inside the tub, and place a green yoga mat on the rim. Install two floating shelves above the tub and arrange bath accessories like towels and containers.</p>

    <h3>Step 12: Decorate the back wall with mirrors, frames, and sink</h3>
    <p>Place the large arched mirror on the right section of the back wall and add three picture frames. Finally, position the glass bowl sink and faucet assembly next to the stairs, filling the sink with water.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inventory Placement:</strong> Ensure perfect alignment with item outlines. Use arrow keys for micro-adjustments.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer Order:</strong> Larger background items should be placed first to avoid snapping issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotation Lock:</strong> Some items, like the round table and planter, only accept one orientation.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlap Warnings:</strong> Watch for red ghost previews indicating collisions. Resolve overlaps before confirming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks from Top Player</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grid-Snap Strategy:</strong> Use the grid overlay for precise alignment of shelves and planters.</li>
      <li><strong>Staggered Ordering:</strong> Use a checkerboard pattern when placing objects to speed up snapping.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory Search:</strong> Use the search filter to quickly find items like towels, plants, or plush toys.</li>
      <li><strong>Preview Mode:</strong> Verify item placement with the preview mode before finalizing each step.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following this guide, you’ll successfully complete Dreamy Room Level 102, transforming the space into a serene, multi-level spa retreat. Enjoy decorating your spa-inspired haven!</p>

In this walkthrough, we’ll guide you step-by-step through the entire Dreamy Room Level 103 solution so you can complete the design efficiently and enjoyably.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Build the elevated cloud bed area</h3>
    <p>Start by placing the large fluffy white mattress in the upper platform center. Add the two soft blue cloud pillows and a crescent moon cushion. Drape the pale sky-blue quilt across the foot for extra coziness.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add wall-mounted lanterns and floating moon light</h3>
    <p>Install two cloud-shaped lanterns on either side of the back wall above the bed. Center the floating crescent moon light directly above the mattress using the ceiling mount.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the transparent wardrobe and curtain screen</h3>
    <p>Place the translucent wardrobe along the left wall of the room. Pull the semi-transparent curtain screen across the lower-left corner to create a private dressing nook.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Install the rainbow rug and plush toy display</h3>
    <p>Lay down the colorful rainbow-shaped rug in the center of the lower level. On top of it, place the floating shelf unit and position three cloud animal plushies (bear, rabbit, unicorn) evenly across the shelf.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Hang picture frames and glowing stars</h3>
    <p>Mount five photo frames in a scattered layout on the right-side wall, each showcasing pastel nature themes. Add three glowing star decorations around the top right corner of the room for ambient lighting.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Arrange the cloud sofa, side table, and tea set</h3>
    <p>Place the cloud-shaped sofa on the right side of the room, facing left. Add a floating pastel side table to its left, and set a white teapot and two cloud-shaped teacups on the table.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Set up reading area with bookshelf and beanbag</h3>
    <p>Drag the small bookshelf into the lower-left corner, next to the curtain screen. Place the oversized sky-blue beanbag in front and add a pastel lamp to its right for the perfect reading light.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Add storage trunks and floating plants</h3>
    <p>Stack two soft-edged storage trunks in the back-right corner of the room. Mount three hanging planters with trailing vines along the top wall rail to complete the natural vibe.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Decorate with wall decals and paper mobiles</h3>
    <p>Stick pastel star and cloud decals along the back wall. Suspend three paper mobiles (moon, star, raindrop) from the ceiling beams for added charm and dynamic motion.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Finish with a mirror and personalized name sign</h3>
    <p>Attach the oval cloud-edged mirror beside the wardrobe. Just below, place the wooden name sign with your chosen nickname using pastel letter tiles.</p>

    <h2>Dreamy Room Level 104 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 104 invites you to create a magical observatory with star maps, telescopes, and galactic ambiance. In this full Dreamy Room Level 104 walkthrough, we detail each step to perfectly construct your cosmic-themed room.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Build the elevated stargazing platform</h3>
    <p>Start by assembling the wooden stargazing deck in the upper-left corner. Add the wide star rug and two space-blue floor cushions aligned diagonally to face the viewing area.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mount the telescope and planetary chart</h3>
    <p>Place the telescope stand at the front of the stargazing platform and aim it upward at a 45-degree angle. Mount the large planetary chart to the back wall above the platform, centering it between two hanging string lights.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add moon shelf and constellation art</h3>
    <p>Attach the crescent moon shelf to the left wall and arrange three glowing jars on it. Add the constellation canvas and two framed galaxy posters to the right side of the room in a triangle layout.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Install the floating bunk and ladder</h3>
    <p>Place the dark blue bunk bed frame near the center-right wall. Position the cloud-shaped mattress and navy bedding on top. Add the metal ladder on the left side of the frame for access.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Arrange storage cubes and astronaut plush</h3>
    <p>Stack four pastel purple storage cubes below the bunk. On top of the leftmost cube, place the small astronaut plush. Next to it, add a pile of space-themed books and a galaxy projector lamp.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Set up the night sky projector and star globe</h3>
    <p>Place the night sky projector on the circular side table beside the bed. Next to it, place the rotating star globe and ensure the light points upward to simulate constellations.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Lay down the nebula carpet and floor lights</h3>
    <p>Spread the purple-pink nebula-themed carpet across the center of the room. Add three dome floor lamps around the edges, pointing inward to softly illuminate the center.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Decorate ceiling with paper planets and glow-in-the-dark stars</h3>
    <p>Hang paper models of planets from the ceiling using invisible wire. Scatter glow-in-the-dark stars across the upper wall and ceiling beams to amplify the cosmic effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Add beanbag reading corner and space comics</h3>
    <p>Set the navy beanbag in the lower-left corner with a low shelf beside it. Place three volumes of space comics on the shelf and a reading lamp above for a cozy study nook.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Finalize with wall clock and name plate</h3>
    <p>Hang the galaxy-patterned wall clock near the door and personalize the star-shaped name plate on the desk using letter tiles in glowing ink.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Dreamy Room Level 104</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lighting Balance:</strong> Use soft blue and purple hues for a relaxing star-gazing atmosphere.</li>
      <li><strong>Placement Order:</strong> Install ceiling and wall decor before beds and furniture to avoid overlap.</li>
      <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> Align wall decorations evenly for an organized observatory effect.</li>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 105 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>Dreamy Room Level 105 immerses you in a tranquil underwater world. With glowing jellyfish lights, coral-shaped furniture, and soothing ocean tones, this walkthrough will help you transform your space into a peaceful aquatic haven.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Lay the oceanic flooring and gradient backdrop</h3>
      <p>Begin by selecting the deep-blue wavy flooring. Pair it with a sea-gradient wall mural that fades from turquoise at the bottom to a pale aqua at the top.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Build the shell-shaped bed setup</h3>
      <p>Position the shell headboard at the center of the back wall. Add the pearl-white mattress and matching seashell pillows. Place the scallop blanket draped neatly across the bed.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Install jellyfish pendant lights</h3>
      <p>Hang two jellyfish pendant lights from the ceiling above the bed—one on each side. Adjust the glow to a soft bluish-purple hue for ambient illumination.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Add coral nightstands and aquatic accessories</h3>
      <p>Place coral-shaped nightstands on both sides of the bed. Decorate them with items like a bubble lamp, a sand dollar clock, and a jar of sea glass pebbles.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Create the bubble reading nook</h3>
      <p>In the left corner, set up a transparent bubble chair suspended from the ceiling. Underneath, add a circular seafoam rug and a small octopus-shaped footrest.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Place the seahorse bookshelf</h3>
      <p>Against the right wall, position the tall seahorse bookshelf. Fill it with aquatic-themed storybooks, conch shells, and glowing crystals.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Build the treasure chest storage area</h3>
      <p>Place a vintage-style treasure chest at the foot of the bed. Keep it slightly open, revealing plush sea stars, a rolled-up map, and a mock pearl necklace.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Decorate with wall-mounted aquatic creatures</h3>
      <p>Mount three framed silhouettes of sea creatures—whale, manta ray, and dolphin—on the left wall in a wave pattern. Add bubble decals around them for a floating effect.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 9: Set up the moonlit aquarium window</h3>
      <p>Install the moonlit ocean-view window on the back wall above the bed. The animated glow simulates moonlight shimmering through moving water.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Finish with seashell rug and ambient sound unit</h3>
      <p>Lay down a large spiral shell rug in the center. Place the ambient sound unit beside the bed and set it to loop soft ocean waves and dolphin calls.</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 106 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>In Dreamy Room Level 106, your goal is to design a magical forest sanctuary. With natural textures, fairy-themed accents, and glowing forest floor vibes, this walkthrough shows you every step to turn your room into an enchanted woodland hideaway.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Lay the mossy forest flooring and tree mural backdrop</h3>
      <p>Start by selecting a dark moss-green carpet for the floor. Apply the forest mural wallpaper on the back wall with silhouettes of tall trees fading into foggy twilight.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Construct the treehouse bunk bed</h3>
      <p>Place the wooden bunk bed designed like a miniature treehouse against the back-left wall. Add bark-textured railings and leaf-patterned bedding. Attach the mini rope ladder to the left side.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Install fairy light garlands and lantern clusters</h3>
      <p>Hang string lights shaped like fireflies around the top edges of the room. Add three glass lanterns with soft yellow light near the treehouse bed for extra glow.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Set up mushroom stools and toadstool table</h3>
      <p>Place two red-and-white mushroom stools near the center of the room. Between them, add a toadstool-shaped table with a glowing ring effect around its base.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Add forest bookshelf and woodland plushies</h3>
      <p>Place the wooden bookshelf carved like a tree trunk against the right wall. Fill it with forest-themed books and add plush figures of owls, foxes, and deer on the lower shelves.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Build the crystal terrarium corner</h3>
      <p>In the front-right corner, set up a glass terrarium filled with glowing crystals, moss, and mini fairy figurines. Place a curved branch lamp above it for gentle illumination.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Place enchanted mirror and ivy wreath</h3>
      <p>Hang the oval-shaped enchanted mirror with a rustic bark frame on the left wall. Above it, add a handmade ivy wreath with twinkling LED accents.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Arrange leaf rug and firefly jar decorations</h3>
      <p>Spread a large autumn-leaf-shaped rug in the center. On either side, place small jars with glowing fireflies that softly blink in intervals.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 9: Create a fairy reading nook</h3>
      <p>In the lower-left corner, set a round moss cushion with a willow branch floor lamp. Add a stack of fairy tale books tied with twine and a mushroom-patterned throw blanket nearby.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Finalize with magical wall decals and name sign</h3>
      <p>Add starburst and leaf swirl decals across the ceiling and side walls. Complete the design with a wood-burned name plate above the bed, customized with glowing lettering.</p>
