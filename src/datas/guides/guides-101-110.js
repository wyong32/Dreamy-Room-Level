    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 101: Desert Restaurant</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 101 challenges you to build a desert-themed restaurant with Egyptian-inspired decor. Follow this step-by-step guide to ensure each item is placed perfectly.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 1: Place the Two Palm Trees on the Platform Edges</h3>
    <p>Start by placing the two palm trees on the southwest and northeast edges of the platform. Ensure they align with the platform's subtle contours for a balanced look.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 2: Place the Cluster of Cacti Around the Island’s Perimeter</h3>
    <p>Position the cacti around the platform, alternating between tall and short ones to create a natural, whimsical edge. Rotate each cactus to align with the notches for proper placement.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 3: Place the Pyramid Roof Centrally on the Base Pad</h3>
    <p>Center the large pyramid roof over the middle of the platform. Align it with the base, ensuring the peak faces forward for a perfect fit.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 4: Place the Glass Window Facade on the West Wall</h3>
    <p>Mount the tall green-tinted window on the left side of the pyramid's base. The window's frame should snap into the notch precisely. Make sure it faces inward at a right angle.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 5: Place the Restaurant Sign and Utensil Emblem Above the Entrance</h3>
    <p>Install the circular white disc sign above the counter opening. Attach the "Restaurant" plaque below it, rotating the text slightly to match the reference image.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 6: Place the Egyptian-Style Pillars at the Front Corners of the Counter</h3>
    <p>Position the ornate yellow and pink pillars at the left and right sides of the counter, ensuring they face inward with the lotus capitals aligned properly.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 7: Place the Red-and-White Counter Unit, Yellow Bar Stools, and Three Countertop Items</h3>
    <p>Place the red-and-white counter in the center front notch. Position the yellow bar stools beneath the counter and arrange the coffee cup, burger plate, and orange juice tumbler on top.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 8: Place the Round Patio Table and Four Chairs on the Front-Left Terrace</h3>
    <p>Place the round table on the front-left terrace, followed by the four red chairs arranged around it. Two chairs should face inward and two outward for balanced seating.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 9: Position the Staircase, Vending Machine, Mummy Figurine, and Fruit Crate</h3>
    <p>On the east side, install the staircase, followed by the vending machine. Add the mummy figurine on the landing and the wooden fruit crate with green melons nearby.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 10: Place the Black-and-Yellow Sphinx Ornament in the Center of the Pyramid Roof</h3>
    <p>Finally, place the black-and-yellow sphinx ornament at the top of the pyramid roof. Ensure it aligns with the notch and locks into place for a dramatic finish.</p>
  
    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Snap-Point Sensitivity:</strong> Be mindful of misalignments. Rotate items slightly if they won’t lock into place.</li>
      <li><strong>Orientation:</strong> Some items, like the Egyptian pillars and sphinx, need to face specific directions. Always check the highlighted outline before placing.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera Angles:</strong> Rotate and zoom as needed to get the best view of the notches and make precise placements.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use the Snap Sound:</strong> Trust the snap sound when an object locks into place—it’s your best indicator of correct placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Take Your Time:</strong> Level 101 is challenging, so don’t rush. Double-check placements for accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>By following this guide, you’ll create a stunning desert restaurant with perfect precision. Enjoy the process and complete Dreamy Room Level 101 with ease!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 102: Spa-Themed Room</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 102 challenges you to create a serene and stylish spa-inspired room with a variety of decorative items. Follow this detailed guide to arrange everything with precision and finesse.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the two cream-colored mattresses on the top platform</h3>
    <p>Begin by placing the two scalloped-edge, cream-colored mattresses side by side on the raised platform at the back of the room. Ensure they are flush against the curved back wall—position the left mattress just to the left of center and the right mattress to the right. This precise placement is crucial for later object alignment.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the plush bunny toys and draped blanket</h3>
    <p>Place the grey bunny plush on the left mattress, facing inward toward the room. On the right mattress, position the yellow bunny plush upright with its feet hanging over the edge. Add the lavender-toned throw blanket across the foot of the right mattress, ensuring it drapes naturally.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mount the floating towel shelf and dual hair dryers</h3>
    <p>Mount the slender wooden floating shelf just below the arch in the back wall, positioning it between the two hair dryer hooks. Place the stacks of folded towels on the shelf, arranged in pastel colors from left to right. Add the pastel purple hair dryers above the left and right mattresses.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Arrange bottles, rolled towels, and pineapple on the glass railing</h3>
    <p>Populate the transparent glass railing with four pastel bottles, aligning them in a straight line along the center. On the left, arrange three rolled towels, and on the far right, place a decorative pineapple sculpture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Build and position the red staircase to the upper level</h3>
    <p>Drag the five pastel red steps and position them on the lower right wall, ensuring they align flush with the lower floor and the top platform.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Construct the shower cubicle and arched shelving unit</h3>
    <p>Create a U-shaped shower cubicle with three panel privacy walls in the lower-left corner. Add the chrome shower fixture inside the cubicle and a green floor mat. Position the arch-topped shelving unit outside the cubicle and fill it with colorful bath bottles and bath balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Hang the shower curtain and decorative floral wreath</h3>
    <p>Install the metal curtain rod across the shower opening and slide the beige curtain onto the rod. Add the floral wreath to the center hook of the curtain rod for a charming accent.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Install the clothing rack, hang garments, and position the towel rack</h3>
    <p>Place the horizontal clothing rod between the shower cubicle and seating area. Hang four pastel jackets from left to right in color order, then place a wooden towel rack in front with neatly arranged towels.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Set up the cozy seating nook with table, chairs, and planter box</h3>
    <p>Place the round wooden table at the center of the lower floor. Arrange the two peach chairs facing each other around the table. Add a pink teapot, teacup, and dessert plate with a pastry. Finally, line up the rectangular planter box with lush green foliage along the front edge of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Add lockers and top-mounted potted plants for storage flair</h3>
    <p>Align four pastel blue lockers side by side along the right lower wall, then stack a fifth locker on top to create a locker column. Top it with a leafy potted plant, and add smaller plants on the adjacent lockers.</p>

    <h3>Step 11: Build the spa tub, place bath accessories, and floating shelves</h3>
    <p>Place the blue rectangular tub on the lower right platform and fill it with water. Add a sheep plush and a rubber duck inside the tub, and place a green yoga mat on the rim. Install two floating shelves above the tub and arrange bath accessories like towels and containers.</p>

    <h3>Step 12: Decorate the back wall with mirrors, frames, and sink</h3>
    <p>Place the large arched mirror on the right section of the back wall and add three picture frames. Finally, position the glass bowl sink and faucet assembly next to the stairs, filling the sink with water.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inventory Placement:</strong> Ensure perfect alignment with item outlines. Use arrow keys for micro-adjustments.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer Order:</strong> Larger background items should be placed first to avoid snapping issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotation Lock:</strong> Some items, like the round table and planter, only accept one orientation.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlap Warnings:</strong> Watch for red ghost previews indicating collisions. Resolve overlaps before confirming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks from Top Player</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grid-Snap Strategy:</strong> Use the grid overlay for precise alignment of shelves and planters.</li>
      <li><strong>Staggered Ordering:</strong> Use a checkerboard pattern when placing objects to speed up snapping.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory Search:</strong> Use the search filter to quickly find items like towels, plants, or plush toys.</li>
      <li><strong>Preview Mode:</strong> Verify item placement with the preview mode before finalizing each step.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following this guide, you’ll successfully complete Dreamy Room Level 102, transforming the space into a serene, multi-level spa retreat. Enjoy decorating your spa-inspired haven!</p>
