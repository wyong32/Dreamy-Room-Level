    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 61: Seaside Paradise</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 61! This delightful puzzle challenges you to arrange seaside-themed objects into their perfect spots. Follow these steps to create a charming coastal paradise.</p>

    <h2>Walkthrough Steps</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Large Shell Structure at the Center</h3>
    <p>Start by placing the large shell-shaped structure in the center of the room on the sandy spot. This shell is the focal point, and all other items will revolve around it.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Beach Umbrellas</h3>
    <p>Place the two blue-and-white beach umbrellas in front of the large shell structure. These umbrellas create a shaded, cozy spot for relaxation.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Set the Picnic Tables and Seating Area</h3>
    <p>Next, position the picnic tables and pink seats beneath the umbrellas, directly in front of the shell. This creates a welcoming area for the green creatures to gather.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Decorate with Green Creatures</h3>
    <p>Place the cute green creatures around the seating area. One lounges in a pink inner tube, two sit at the table, and others can be seated around the area, adding a lively touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Arrange the Decorative Items and Food</h3>
    <p>Place food items like cupcakes and drinks on the picnic tables, ensuring they are evenly spaced for a balanced look.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Enhance with Beach Toys</h3>
    <p>Place colorful beach balls around the seating area to introduce playful elements and complement the whimsical theme of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Finalize with Coral and Seaweed</h3>
    <p>Complete the seaside paradise by placing coral formations (in orange, red, and pink) and green seaweed around the perimeter of the sandy area. These elements frame the scene and enhance the oceanic vibe.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Be mindful of not overcrowding areas. Proper spacing enhances the aesthetics and gameplay satisfaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on Harmony:</strong> Dreamy Room Level 61 is about creating a harmonious arrangement. Pay close attention to placement hints provided during gameplay.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Forced Placements:</strong> Ensure each item fits naturally in its environment. A relaxed and inviting atmosphere is key to completing the level successfully.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use the Snapping Feature:</strong> If you're unsure about placement, temporarily place an item and see if it "snaps" into position. This feature will help guide you.</li>
      <li><strong>No Timers:</strong> Since Dreamy Room Level 61 has no timers, take your time experimenting with different configurations until you get it right.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Similar Items:</strong> Grouping similar items or coordinating colors can help you find the ideal layout more quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>With these steps, you'll turn Dreamy Room Level 61 into a serene and charming seaside retreat, where every item plays a part in telling a delightful story. Enjoy the calming atmosphere and have fun decorating!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 63: Beautifully Decorated Haven</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 63! In this level, you will transform an empty room into a beautifully decorated haven by carefully arranging each piece of furniture and decoration. Precision is key, so follow these steps closely for a stunning result.</p>

    <h3>Walkthrough Steps</h3>

    <h2>Step 1: Place the Modern Sofa on the South Wall</h2>
    <p>Start by placing the modern, plush sofa along the south wall. The sofa's back should be flush with the wall and perfectly centered. This will set the tone for the entire room.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Position the Decorative Coffee Table in Front of the Sofa</h2>
    <p>Now, place a decorative coffee table directly in front of the sofa. Ensure it is centered in relation to the sofa to provide a balanced space for decor. This is a crucial step for achieving harmony in the room.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Lay Down the Area Rug Under the Coffee Table</h2>
    <p>Lay a luxurious area rug across the center of the floor. The rug should extend slightly beyond the coffee table, creating a unified and cozy atmosphere. This will add warmth and comfort to the space.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Install the Bookshelf on the East Wall</h2>
    <p>Place a tall bookshelf along the east wall, spanning from the floor to just below the window. Fill the bookshelf with books and personal items to enhance the narrative and aesthetic of the room.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Hang the Framed Painting on the North Wall</h2>
    <p>Hang a framed painting on the north wall, centered above a console table or shelf. This artwork will serve as a focal point, contributing to the room's artistic and balanced look.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Position the Floor Lamp in the Southwest Corner</h2>
    <p>Position a stylish floor lamp in the southwest corner of the room. The lamp should cast a soft, inviting glow across the seating area. Lighting is essential for setting the mood in this level.</p>

    <h2>Step 7: Set the Potted Plant on the North-East Window Sill</h2>
    <p>Place a vibrant potted plant on the north-east window sill. Center it on the ledge, ensuring it benefits from natural light. This element will bring a fresh, natural touch to the room.</p>

    <h2>Step 8: Hang the Decorative Mirror on the West Wall</h2>
    <p>Hang a decorative mirror on the west wall, above a small console table. The mirror will reflect light, making the space feel larger and more open, adding depth to the room.</p>

    <h2>Step 9: Arrange Small Decorative Items on Surfaces</h2>
    <p>Decorate the coffee table, bookshelf, and console table with small items like a vintage vase, framed photos, and a classic clock. Carefully arrange these objects to enhance the room’s balance and narrative.</p>

    <h2>Step 10: Final Adjustments and Lighting Checks</h2>
    <p>Finally, review your placements and ensure everything is aligned correctly. Check that the lighting highlights key features of the room, making the space feel cohesive and inviting.</p>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>

    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Visualize the final layout of the room before placing any items. A sketch or rough outline can help.</li>
      <li><strong>Utilize Hints:</strong> Pay attention to the subtle hints provided by the game for each placement. These will guide you towards the perfect arrangement.</li>
      <li><strong>Experiment Freely:</strong> If something doesn’t feel right, don’t hesitate to adjust the placement. The game encourages experimentation to find the best setup.</li>
      <li><strong>Save Your Progress:</strong> Regularly save your game after making significant placements to avoid losing progress if you need to retry.</li>
      <li><strong>Maximize Lighting:</strong> Use both natural and artificial lighting to assess how each object looks under different lighting conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Revisit and Revise:</strong> If the layout doesn’t satisfy you, review your steps and make minor adjustments. Sometimes a small change can make a big difference.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 64: Heartfelt and Cozy Room</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 64! In this level, you'll turn a plain, empty room into a space filled with warmth and personal charm. The key to success lies in thoughtful object placement, where each item has a meaningful place. Let's dive into the steps that will transform this room into a heartfelt haven.</p>

    <h3>Walkthrough Steps</h3>

    <h2>Step 1: Assess the Empty Room</h2>
    <p>Start by examining the empty room. The room has plain white walls, a large window on the right, and a simple door on the left. Visualize where each item will be placed to create a cozy, inviting atmosphere.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Place the Vintage Sofa in the Center</h2>
    <p>Select the vintage sofa with soft, worn fabric and place it directly in the center of the room. The sofa should face the window, allowing natural light to flood the space. This will set the foundation for a welcoming vibe in Dreamy Room Level 64.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Set the Coffee Table in Front of the Sofa</h2>
    <p>Now, place a rectangular wooden coffee table in front of the sofa. Make sure it’s perfectly centered with the sofa. The coffee table not only adds functionality but enhances the room’s warmth and elegance.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Arrange the Side Table and Lamp</h2>
    <p>Place a small side table to the right of the sofa and set a decorative lamp on it. The soft glow of the lamp is essential for creating a balanced lighting scheme, giving the room an inviting, cozy feel.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Add Potted Plants and Window Decorations</h2>
    <p>Bring life into the room by placing potted plants on the windowsill. The greenery will complement the natural light streaming through the window. Optionally, add a lightweight curtain or drape to soften the window's edge and enhance the decor.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Hang the Family Portrait and Wall Art</h2>
    <p>Hang a framed family portrait on the left wall. Above the portrait, add a small collection of decorative wall art to bring personality and depth to the room. These personal touches make the space feel more alive and meaningful.</p>

    <h2>Step 7: Organize the Bookshelf and Display Curios</h2>
    <p>Place a classic wooden bookshelf along the far left wall. On the shelf, arrange a mix of books, trinkets, and personal mementos. This step is all about carefully organizing the items to tell a story and bring balance to the room.</p>

    <h2>Step 8: Lay Down the Decorative Rug and Final Accent Pieces</h2>
    <p>Spread a patterned rug right in the center of the room. This rug will unify the space and anchor the various decor elements. Finish off the look with an antique clock on a low table and a set of coasters on the coffee table to add those final touches of charm.</p>

    <h2>Step 9: Fine-Tune Object Placement for Perfect Balance</h2>
    <p>Take a step back and evaluate the room. Fine-tune the placement of each item to ensure balance. Adjust the sofa, bookshelf, or even the lamps slightly to achieve the perfect harmony. Every piece must feel like it belongs in the space.</p>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Observation is Key:</strong> Each object has a story. Study them closely to understand their ideal placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Trial and Error:</strong> Don’t rush. Try different configurations and take your time to find the perfect layout.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Overcrowding:</strong> Ensure that each object has enough space to shine. Too many items can make the room feel cluttered.</li>
      <li><strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> Small adjustments to alignment and spacing can make a big difference in creating a harmonious room.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Group by Theme:</strong> Try grouping similar items together to create a cohesive look, such as vintage or modern decor.</li>
      <li><strong>Leverage Natural Light:</strong> Use the window placement to enhance the ambiance. Natural light can make the room feel warmer and more inviting.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Before placing anything, visualize the room’s final layout. This will help you avoid unnecessary adjustments later on.</li>
      <li><strong>Make Incremental Adjustments:</strong> Small shifts can make a big impact. Don’t hesitate to adjust the position of objects until everything feels balanced.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Hints:</strong> If you’re stuck, use the in-game hints to guide your placements without revealing the full solution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>With these steps, you’ll create a cozy and heartfelt room that tells a story. Enjoy the process and remember that every item you place contributes to the room’s charm!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 67: Vintage and Cozy Living Space</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 67! In this level, your challenge is to turn a blank room into a vintage-inspired, cozy living space by carefully placing each item. The key to success in this level is precision, symmetry, and creating a harmonious atmosphere with thoughtful decor choices.</p>

    <h3>Walkthrough Steps</h3>

    <h2>Step 1: Lay the Central Area Rug</h2>
    <p>Begin by placing a vintage-patterned area rug in the center of the room. This rug serves as the foundation for the room’s design, with its bold design setting the tone. Make sure the edges of the rug align symmetrically with the room’s boundaries for a balanced look.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Position the Plush Sofa Along the Back Wall</h2>
    <p>Take the plush three-seater sofa and position it against the back wall (the northern wall if facing the room’s entrance). This creates a natural focal point in the room and allows the other pieces to be arranged around it. Ensure there’s enough space on either side for additional items.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Set the Antique Coffee Table</h2>
    <p>Place the antique wooden coffee table directly in front of the sofa, centered perfectly. Leave enough space around the table to ensure a balanced, functional seating area.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Add the Decorative Armchair in the Left Corner</h2>
    <p>Find the left corner of the room near the entrance and place the elegant armchair there. This vintage piece adds charm and serves as a statement item. Position it so it faces slightly toward the coffee table, seamlessly integrating it into the seating area.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Position the Vintage Floor Lamp</h2>
    <p>Next to the armchair, place the vintage floor lamp. Its warm light is essential for creating a cozy atmosphere. Ensure the lamp illuminates both the armchair and the surrounding area without overwhelming the space.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Set Up the Bookshelf on the Right Wall</h2>
    <p>Place the tall, wooden bookshelf against the right wall. The bookshelf brings balance to the soft textures of the sofa and armchair, and it also reflects the room’s history. Make sure it is aligned straight to maintain a neat, organized look.</p>

    <h2>Step 7: Place the Potted Plant by the Window</h2>
    <p>Position a vibrant potted plant next to the window. This placement allows the plant to capture natural light, emphasizing its fresh green hue. The plant adds a refreshing touch to the room's overall decor.</p>

    <h2>Step 8: Hang the Tasteful Painting on the Main Wall</h2>
    <p>Choose a serene, calming painting and hang it above the sofa on the main wall. Ensure the painting is centered with respect to the sofa to maintain symmetry and thematic unity in the room.</p>

    <h2>Step 9: Install the Ornate Mirror on the Secondary Wall</h2>
    <p>Hang an ornate mirror on the opposite wall from the painting. The mirror adds depth to the room and enhances its reflective qualities, making the space feel larger. Align the edges of the mirror to complement the other decorative elements.</p>

    <h2>Step 10: Arrange Accents and Final Touches</h2>
    <p>Finally, add finishing touches to the room:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cushions & Throws:</strong> Arrange decorative cushions and throws on the sofa and armchair for added texture and color.</li>
      <li><strong>Decorative Vase:</strong> Place a chic vase with flowers on the coffee table to bring an elegant touch to the space.</li>
      <li><strong>Small Memorabilia:</strong> Add a few personal trinkets or keepsakes to the bookshelves or side tables to complete the storytelling aspect of the room.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each detail matters in Dreamy Room Level 67, so review your work and make sure every item is in the right place.</p>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions for Dreamy Room Level 67</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Object Placement:</strong> The main challenge in this level is positioning each object correctly. Double-check your placements to ensure they align with the overall design.</li>
      <li><strong>Symmetry and Balance:</strong> Symmetry is key in Dreamy Room Level 67. Ensure large pieces like the sofa, coffee table, and bookshelf are aligned to maintain balance in the room.</li>
      <li><strong>Lighting & Ambiance:</strong> Be mindful of how the floor lamp and natural light from the window interact to create a warm atmosphere. Avoid blocking these light sources.</li>
      <li><strong>Space Management:</strong> Avoid overcrowding the room. Leave enough space between objects to allow each piece to tell its own part of the story.</li>
      <li><strong>Review Before Finalizing:</strong> Step back and review the entire layout. Small misalignments can detract from the room’s aesthetic, so make any necessary adjustments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks for Dreamy Room Level 67</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Preview Mode:</strong> Use the preview mode to see how objects look before finalizing their position. This can help you avoid any misplacements.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Visualize the layout before starting. Sketch out a rough plan to keep track of object placements.</li>
      <li><strong>Utilize Symmetry:</strong> Arranging objects symmetrically often leads to a more harmonious design. Refer back to the walkthrough for guidance.</li>
      <li><strong>Adjust Flexibly:</strong> Don’t hesitate to adjust objects slightly if the flow of the room doesn’t feel quite right.</li>
      <li><strong>Small Details Count:</strong> Pay attention to minor details such as artwork angles or the placement of decor—these small touches will elevate your design.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay Patient:</strong> Take your time to ensure every detail is perfect. Precision and patience are key to achieving the best result.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dreamy Room Level 68 Walkthrough – Heartfelt, Memory-Laden Environment</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 68, your task is to transform an empty space into a nostalgic, cozy environment filled with personal and sentimental items. Every piece in this room, from the vintage rug to the family photo, plays a key role in telling the story of cherished memories. Follow these steps to create a space that feels personal and inviting.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Lay the Vintage Oriental Rug</h3>
    <p>Start by laying down a large vintage oriental rug with intricate red and gold patterns. Position it squarely in the center of the room, ensuring it is perfectly aligned with the room’s axes. The rug will serve as the foundational piece of the room’s decor, setting the stage for everything that follows.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Deep Blue Velvet Sofa</h3>
    <p>Place the deep blue velvet sofa along the left wall, making sure its back is flush with the wall. The center of the sofa should align with the room’s midpoint. This strategic placement creates a welcoming atmosphere and sets up the room for the other decorative elements. Ensure there’s enough space on the adjacent side for a side table.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Set the Rustic Wooden Coffee Table</h3>
    <p>Next, position a rustic wooden coffee table directly in front of the sofa. This table should become the focal point of the room, placed centrally between the seating area and the rest of the decor. The natural wood finish brings warmth and texture, complementing the rug and sofa.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Hang the Abstract Painting</h3>
    <p>Enhance the room’s sentimental atmosphere by hanging a colorful abstract painting above the sofa. Align the center of the painting with the midpoint of the sofa to create visual balance. This piece will not only beautify the space but also add a layer of emotional depth to the room, symbolizing the memories behind each object.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Install the Tall Wooden Bookshelf</h3>
    <p>On the right wall, install a tall wooden bookshelf with glass doors. This piece should stretch from nearly the floor to the ceiling, providing ample space to display your collection of mementos and keepsakes. The bookshelf is both practical and decorative, reinforcing the theme of cherished memories.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Arrange the Modern Floor Lamp</h3>
    <p>In the top right corner of the room, place a modern floor lamp with a soft white shade. This lamp will illuminate the room with a warm glow, accentuating the ambiance of the space and tying together the seating and display areas.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Set Up the Side Table with a Vintage Ceramic Lamp</h3>
    <p>Place a small, round side table next to the sofa, and set a vintage ceramic lamp on it. This lamp adds a nostalgic touch to the room and helps create a cozy, intimate atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Arrange the Cozy Armchair and Matching Throw Pillow</h3>
    <p>In the bottom left corner of the room, position a light grey armchair with a matching throw pillow in the deep blue shade of the sofa. This creates a cozy reading nook and emphasizes the room’s personal and inviting atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Hang the Ornate Decorative Mirror</h3>
    <p>On the wall opposite the entrance, hang an ornate decorative mirror. Make sure its reflective surface is angled for optimal light diffusion. The mirror not only amplifies the sense of space but also symbolizes reflection and memories, enhancing the emotional impact of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Add Final Decorative Accents</h3>
    <p>Complete the room by adding the final touches:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Potted Plant:</strong> Place a small potted plant on the coffee table for a pop of natural green.</li>
      <li><strong>Framed Family Photo:</strong> Set a framed black-and-white family photo on the side table near the sofa.</li>
      <li><strong>Window Treatments:</strong> Drape elegant patterned curtains over the large window on the right wall.</li>
      <li><strong>Vintage Clock:</strong> Hang a vintage clock above the bookshelf as a reminder of the passage of time and the importance of each moment.</li>

    <h2>Dreamy Room Level 69 Walkthrough – Luxury and Contemporary Living Room</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 69, your goal is to create a luxurious and contemporary living room that feels both chic and inviting. The layout challenges you to find the perfect position for each object to achieve a well-balanced and stylish space. Follow these steps for a harmonious and refined room design.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Empty Space</h3>
    <p>Begin with an empty room. Clear the space to ensure there are no obstructions before you begin placing any furniture or decor. Take a moment to visualize the design you’re aiming for.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Cream-Colored Sofa</h3>
    <p>Place the plush cream-colored sofa in the lower left corner of the room. Ensure it faces the center of the room, allowing for easy placement of other elements. The sofa will serve as the focal point of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Accent Chair</h3>
    <p>Place a stylish accent chair adjacent to the sofa, angled slightly towards the center of the room to create a cozy conversation area. This enhances the welcoming atmosphere of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Center the Round Coffee Table</h3>
    <p>Position the round coffee table between the sofa and the accent chair, ensuring it is centered in front of both pieces. This acts as the room’s centerpiece, providing balance and functionality.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Lay the Decorative Rug</h3>
    <p>Spread a patterned rug underneath the coffee table and seating area. The rug should align with the sofa and accent chair, enhancing the room’s comfort and aesthetic appeal.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Place the Floor Lamp</h3>
    <p>Install the vintage floor lamp next to the sofa in the lower left corner. Ensure it casts a soft, ambient light that doesn’t overpower the other elements but creates a warm atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Hang the Abstract Painting</h3>
    <p>Place a vibrant abstract painting above the sofa. The painting should be centered and aligned with the width of the sofa, adding visual interest and personality to the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Install the Wooden Bookshelf</h3>
    <p>Position a wooden bookshelf along the right wall. This piece should hold a combination of books and trinkets, showcasing personal mementos that add character to the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Hang the Decorative Mirror</h3>
    <p>Install a decorative mirror on the back wall to reflect light and create the illusion of a larger space. Center it horizontally to complement the room’s balance.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Add the Potted Succulent</h3>
    <p>Place a small potted succulent on the coffee table. This touch of greenery adds a refreshing contrast to the room’s other elements and brings a natural vibe to the space.</p>

    <h3>Step 11: Final Touches</h3>
    <p>Complete the room by adding finishing touches:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decorative Vase with Flowers:</strong> Place on a side table near the bookshelf.</li>
      <li><strong>Throw Pillows:</strong> Arrange a set of throw pillows on the sofa.</li>
      <li><strong>Side Table with Personal Memorabilia:</strong> Position near the accent chair.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ensure that every item is placed with care, creating a cohesive and inviting space.</p>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precision in Placement:</strong> Each item’s position is crucial to achieving the perfect balance in the room.</li>
      <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> Maintain symmetry and alignment to create a harmonious look.</li>
      <li><strong>Time and Patience:</strong> Take your time with each step to achieve the desired result.</li>
      <li><strong>Trial and Error:</strong> Don’t be afraid to rearrange items if the placement doesn’t feel right.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start with the Sofa:</strong> Begin by placing the main sofa, as it sets the foundation for the room’s layout.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Symmetry:</strong> Ensure the layout is balanced for a cohesive design.</li>
      <li><strong>Take Your Time:</strong> Experiment with the placement of each object before finalizing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dreamy Room Level 70 Walkthrough – Modern Elegance and Bright Accents</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 70, you’ll design a chic modern living room featuring sleek furniture and vibrant accents. Precision in placement is key to creating a cohesive, stylish space. Follow these steps for the perfect setup.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Lay the Foundation with the Area Rug</h3>
    <p>Start by placing a soft rectangular area rug in the center of the room. Its long side should align with the room’s main axis for symmetry. This rug serves as the base for all other furniture placements.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Modern Sofa</h3>
    <p>Place the deep blue sofa along the left wall, directly adjacent to the rug. Ensure the back of the sofa is flush with the wall, maintaining spatial harmony in the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Set Up the Glass-Topped Coffee Table</h3>
    <p>Position a rectangular glass coffee table in front of the sofa, centered on the rug. Make sure the table is equidistant from the sofa and the armchair, achieving a balanced layout.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Arrange the Cozy Armchair</h3>
    <p>Place the armchair to the right of the coffee table, angled slightly towards the sofa. This setup creates a welcoming conversation area.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Decorate the Coffee Table</h3>
    <p>Embellish the coffee table with a modern vase centered on the table, and add a stack of vintage books to the left. These touches elevate the room’s sophistication and reflect the game’s challenge of precise placement.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Hang the Signature Abstract Painting</h3>
    <p>Mount a large, abstract painting on the wall behind the sofa. It should be centered above the seating area, creating a focal point that enhances the room’s modern vibe.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Install the Tall Bookshelf</h3>
    <p>Place a tall bookshelf on the far right wall, opposite the armchair. Fill it with books and personal mementos to add both function and personality to the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Position the Arching Floor Lamp</h3>
    <p>Install an arching floor lamp near the bookshelf, providing soft, ambient lighting that complements the room’s mood. This placement also highlights the textures of the furniture.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Enhance with a Framed Mirror and Potted Plants</h3>
    <p>Hang a rectangular framed mirror between the armchair and the window. Place two small potted succulents on the window sill on either side of the mirror to add a touch of greenery and enlarge the space visually.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Drape Elegant Curtains</h3>
    <p>Hang sheer curtains on the large window, ensuring they extend from the ceiling to the floor. Position them evenly to frame the window with grace and symmetry.</p>

    <h3>Step 11: Set Up the Side Table with a Reading Lamp</h3>
    <p>Place a small side table next to the sofa, with a reading lamp on top. Add a coffee mug and a stack of magazines to create a cozy, functional spot for relaxation.</p>

    <h3>Step 12: Integrate Ambient LED Lighting</h3>
    <p>Install LED strip lights under the bookshelf and above the mirror. Adjust the brightness so the lighting is just right, enhancing the room’s atmosphere without being too overpowering.</p>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Placement Precision:</strong> Each item has a dedicated spot. Recheck alignment if anything seems off.</li>
      <li><strong>Scale Consistency:</strong> Ensure all objects are appropriately sized relative to the overall room layout.</li>
      <li><strong>Take Your Time:</strong> Rushing the placement may result in imbalance. Experiment and adjust until everything feels right.</li>
      <li><strong>Step Back and Review:</strong> Frequently assess the room’s layout from different angles to ensure harmony.</li>
      <li><strong>Fragile Items:</strong> Handle delicate items like the vase and LED strips with care to avoid misplacement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Sketch a layout beforehand to maintain balance as you place key items like the rug and sofa.</li>
      <li><strong>Use the Pause Feature:</strong> If unsure about a placement, pause and reassess your design. A fresh perspective can reveal helpful adjustments.</li>
      <li><strong>Lighting Adjustments:</strong> Experiment with the floor lamp and LED strip settings to find the ideal lighting for the space.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer Your Decor:</strong> Mixing textures—like a soft rug with a glass coffee table—adds depth to the design.</li>
      <li><strong>Symmetry Matters:</strong> Pay attention to symmetry, especially with curtains and artwork placement, to maintain balance in the room.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Touches:</strong> Every item in the room tells a story. Add personal items like books and plants to bring your space to life.</li>
