    <h2>Dreamy Room Level 71 Walkthrough – Sleek Urban Studio with Retro Vibes</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 71, you’ll design a chic urban studio combining modern aesthetics with retro touches. From vintage lighting to bold artwork, every placement contributes to a vibrant and personalized space.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Lay Down the Geometric Area Rug</h3>
    <p>Begin by placing a large geometric rug in the center of the room. The bold design of the rug sets the tone for the entire room, so make sure it's centered and aligned with the room’s main axis.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Retro-Inspired Sofa</h3>
    <p>Place the plush retro-inspired sofa against the left wall. The deep, rich colors of the sofa contrast with the room's other modern elements, adding a touch of nostalgia while maintaining a sleek appearance.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Set the Minimalist Coffee Table</h3>
    <p>Place a minimalist coffee table in front of the sofa. It should be centered on the rug and placed a few inches away from the sofa to allow comfortable seating access.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Hang the Bold Abstract Art</h3>
    <p>Mount a large, bold abstract painting on the wall behind the sofa. The colors and shapes in the painting should complement the modern retro vibe, creating a striking focal point.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Install the Vintage Floor Lamp</h3>
    <p>Position a vintage-inspired floor lamp near the corner of the room, casting a soft, ambient light across the space. The lamp should add warmth and depth, enhancing the overall atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Arrange the Open Bookshelf</h3>
    <p>Install an open, industrial-style bookshelf on the far right wall. Fill it with an assortment of books and retro-inspired decor items, ensuring everything is arranged with care to highlight its personal significance.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Position the Potted Plants</h3>
    <p>Place a couple of potted plants around the room, especially near the windows. The greenery brings a touch of nature into the urban setting, adding life to the studio space.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Add a Framed Mirror Above the Sofa</h3>
    <p>Hang a framed mirror above the sofa. The mirror reflects the space, making the room feel larger and brighter while contributing to the retro aesthetic.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Set the Side Table with a Table Lamp</h3>
    <p>Place a side table next to the sofa and add a table lamp with a vintage design. This piece not only serves a functional purpose but also enhances the room’s atmosphere with its soft lighting.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Final Touches and Adjustments</h3>
    <p>Take a step back and evaluate the room’s layout. Make any necessary adjustments to furniture placement, ensuring that everything aligns symmetrically and that the space feels balanced. Add personal touches like decorative bowls or a retro clock to complete the look.</p>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alignment is Key:</strong> Ensure all furniture pieces are properly aligned, especially the rug and sofa.</li>
      <li><strong>Mind the Lighting:</strong> Position the floor lamp and table lamps to ensure that they provide enough light without overwhelming the space.</li>
      <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> Aim for balance in placement, especially with the artwork and furniture arrangement.</li>
      <li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> If something feels off, make small adjustments. The game rewards precision and careful thought.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start Big:</strong> Begin by placing the largest pieces first, like the rug, sofa, and bookshelf, to establish the room's overall framework.</li>
      <li><strong>Layering is Essential:</strong> Mix textures like soft fabrics, vintage wood, and sleek metal to create depth and interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Lighting Matters:</strong> Experiment with different light sources, especially the vintage lamp, to create the perfect ambiance.</li>
      <li><strong>Play with Color:</strong> Retro colors should complement the modern elements—use bold colors wisely to add energy without overwhelming the space.</li>
      <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Incorporate personal mementos or items that reflect your style—books, plants, and unique decor will make the space feel truly yours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dreamy Room Level 72 Walkthrough – Antique Charm and Personal Touches</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 72, your primary challenge is to determine the correct placement for each object. Every item—from the antique bookshelf to the delicate houseplant—tells part of a larger story. The joy lies in crafting a space that feels personal and balanced. Follow these steps to transform the room into a beautifully decorated haven.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Antique Wooden Bookshelf on the Left Wall</h3>
    <p>Start by positioning the antique wooden bookshelf along the left wall. Make sure the base is aligned with the floor and the top edge reaches just below the ceiling height. Center it on the wall, leaving room for other furnishings. The bookshelf will house mementos and personal books, telling a lifetime's story.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Cozy Reading Chair in the Top Left Corner</h3>
    <p>Next, place a comfortable reading chair in the top left corner near the bookshelf. Angle it slightly toward the center of the room for a cozy nook. This placement balances the room’s layout and provides a warm, inviting spot for reading.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Lay the Pastel-Colored Rug in the Center</h3>
    <p>Place a soft, pastel-colored rug in the center of the room. This rug should unify the space and anchor the furniture. Ensure it’s large enough to cover the central seating area and aligned with the room’s boundaries for symmetry.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Install the Plush Sofa Along the Bottom Center</h3>
    <p>Position the plush sofa along the bottom center of the room, facing the center. Ensure that it doesn’t block windows or doorways. Its soft colors and inviting design enhance the intimate feel of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Set the Coffee Table in Front of the Sofa</h3>
    <p>Place a stylish coffee table directly in front of the sofa. It should be centered, providing a functional and decorative space. Make sure the coffee table is within easy reach for the sofa's seating area.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Mount the Vintage Mirror on the Right Wall</h3>
    <p>Mount the vintage mirror on the right wall, at eye level and slightly off-center. The mirror adds depth and reflects light, contributing to the room’s airy feel and balancing the design elements of the bookshelf and sofa.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Arrange the Desk, Computer, and Lamp Near the Window</h3>
    <p>Set up a desk near a window, equipped with a computer and modern lamp. This workspace provides a functional area while taking advantage of natural light. Keep the desk away from high-traffic areas to maintain a calm atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Hang the Framed Family Photographs and Artwork on the Walls</h3>
    <p>Decorate the walls with framed family photos and artwork. Arrange them symmetrically around the bookshelf and mirror, creating a gallery-like effect. This adds personality and emotional depth to the space.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Add a Houseplant in the Corner</h3>
    <p>Place a lush houseplant in one corner of the room. Select a plant that thrives indoors and benefits from ample natural light. This addition enhances the calm atmosphere of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Install the Elegant Chandelier in the Center Ceiling</h3>
    <p>Install an elegant chandelier in the center of the ceiling. This fixture adds a focal point and illuminates the space, enhancing the ambiance and making the room feel more inviting.</p>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Symmetry and Balance:</strong> Ensure all objects are symmetrically placed to maintain harmony in the room.</li>
      <li><strong>Scale and Proportion:</strong> Verify that all items are appropriately sized relative to their space.</li>
      <li><strong>Object Interaction:</strong> Avoid overcrowding; ensure each item can be appreciated in its own space.</li>
      <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Make sure heavy items like the bookshelf and sofa are securely positioned to prevent accidental movement.</li>
      <li><strong>Patience:</strong> Take your time with placements. Rushing may compromise the overall design and narrative of the room.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Sketch a layout of the room to help visualize the furniture placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Similar Items:</strong> Create visual harmony by grouping related items together.</li>
      <li><strong>Adjust Lighting:</strong> Experiment with the placement of the chandelier and lamps to enhance the room's mood.</li>
      <li><strong>Test Arrangements:</strong> If unsure, try different placements to find the perfect setup.</li>
      <li><strong>Use In-Game Hints:</strong> If you’re stuck, take advantage of in-game hints to fine-tune the placement of objects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dreamy Room Level 73 Walkthrough – Creating a Cozy, Balanced Haven</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 73, your challenge is to carefully arrange furniture, decorative accents, and lighting to create a cozy, balanced space. The room features a vintage sofa, patterned rug, and other carefully selected items. Let's dive into the step-by-step process of transforming this empty room.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Survey the Empty Space in Dreamy Room Level 73</h3>
    <p>Start by inspecting the room's empty canvas. Look around the perimeter to see where the natural light sources, windows, and doorways are. Consider where the main furniture and focal points will be placed for a balanced layout.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Establish the Focal Point with the Main Seating Area</h3>
    <p>Position the vintage sofa against the left wall near the large window. This not only gives the sofa ample natural light but also creates symmetry. Ensure that the sofa is centrally aligned to other elements, such as the coffee table and artwork.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Position the Coffee Table at the Heart of the Room</h3>
    <p>Place the wooden coffee table directly in front of the sofa. This table will act as the central anchor for the room, balancing the seating area and adding visual weight to the space.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Lay Down the Decorative Rug</h3>
    <p>Spread the cozy patterned rug underneath the coffee table. Ensure it extends slightly beyond the sofa's seating area to create a grounded and unified feel. The rug's design should complement the room’s color scheme.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Adorn the Walls with Art and Accents</h3>
    <p>Hang a large, classic painting on the back wall above the coffee table, and place a series of smaller framed photographs on the right wall. These accents will give the room personality and depth, which is essential for Dreamy Room Level 73’s narrative style.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Introduce Greenery with Indoor Plants</h3>
    <p>Add a lush potted plant in the bottom right corner and a smaller succulent arrangement on the window sill. The greenery will provide a refreshing, natural touch to balance the room's vintage decor.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Illuminate the Room with Layered Lighting</h3>
    <p>Install a decorative chandelier in the center of the ceiling to provide soft, ambient lighting. To enhance the mood, add a floor lamp in the bottom left corner and a stylish table lamp near the sofa for a cozy, layered lighting effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Accessorize with Key Decorative Items</h3>
    <p>Add a stack of well-chosen books and a decorative vase on the coffee table. Place a vintage clock or trinket box on the side table near the sofa. These accessories will add charm and personal character to the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Finalize with Comfort and Cohesion</h3>
    <p>Arrange patterned cushions on the sofa in a balanced, symmetrical manner. Step back and assess the room's overall cohesion. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure all items are aligned and contribute to a harmonious and inviting space.</p>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precision Matters:</strong> Ensure that all objects are precisely placed, as small misalignments can affect the overall balance of the room.</li>
      <li><strong>Minimal Clutter:</strong> Avoid overcrowding the space. Dreamy Room Level 73 thrives on simplicity and thoughtful arrangements.</li>
      <li><strong>Lighting Consistency:</strong> Ensure that all light sources are balanced to create the right mood. Overly bright or dim lighting can disrupt the ambiance.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay True to the Theme:</strong> Keep the room’s color scheme and vintage aesthetic in mind when placing new items. Consistency is key.</li>
      <li><strong>Patience is Key:</strong> Take your time to perfect the placement of each item, as minor tweaks may be needed for the ideal look.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sketch a Layout:</strong> Before placing items, sketch a rough layout of the room to ensure all pieces fit cohesively.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Natural Guides:</strong> Utilize the natural light and the room's architecture to guide where items should be placed.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer Your Lighting:</strong> Use ambient, task, and accent lighting to create depth and warmth in the space.</li>
      <li><strong>Embrace Minimalism:</strong> Keep the room’s decor minimal but meaningful. Focus on quality over quantity.</li>
      <li><strong>Reevaluate as You Go:</strong> Don’t hesitate to move items around if the layout feels off. Experimenting can lead to better placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Seek Inspiration:</strong> If you’re unsure, take a look at the completed image for inspiration on how to place intricate details.</li>

    <h2>Dreamy Room Level 74 Walkthrough – Creating a Warm, Timeless Space</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 74, your goal is to design a room that exudes warmth and nostalgia. Every item in this room tells a story, and your task is to position each piece thoughtfully to create an inviting, timeless space. Follow the steps below to ensure the room is balanced, harmonious, and full of sentimental value.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Lay the Foundation with the Area Rug</h3>
    <p>Begin by placing the large, vintage-patterned area rug in the center of the room. This rug is essential for anchoring the design of the space and setting a warm tone. Ensure the rug is perfectly centered so its borders extend evenly, creating a balanced foundation for the objects that follow.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Cream-Colored Sofa on the East Wall</h3>
    <p>Place the cream-colored sofa against the east wall. This placement allows natural light to stream in through the window, highlighting the sofa's soft tones. The blue throw pillows add a pop of color and contrast with the neutral sofa, making this piece the centerpiece of the seating area.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Set the Round Wooden Coffee Table in Front of the Sofa</h3>
    <p>Position the round wooden coffee table directly in front of the sofa. Make sure it is at a comfortable distance from the seating area, allowing easy access while maintaining an open flow in the room. This table will be the functional centerpiece of the space.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Arrange the Light Grey Armchairs Flanking the Coffee Table</h3>
    <p>Place two matching light grey armchairs on either side of the coffee table. Arrange them symmetrically so they face towards the table, forming a cohesive conversation area. This setup creates an inviting and balanced seating arrangement, essential to the room's overall harmony.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add a Tall Potted Plant Near the Window Corner</h3>
    <p>Place a tall potted plant in the left corner near the window. The plant's lush green leaves will bring nature into the space, and positioning it close to the window allows sunlight to highlight its details. The addition of greenery adds a refreshing, organic element to the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Install the Antique Wooden Bookshelf on the North Wall</h3>
    <p>Mount an antique wooden bookshelf along the north wall. Fill it with classic novels, personal mementos, and sentimental trinkets. This bookshelf not only enhances the visual appeal of the room but also contributes to the narrative of time and memory, deepening the room's emotional resonance.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Hang the Decorative Wall Clock Above the Mantle</h3>
    <p>Hang a decorative wall clock featuring Roman numerals above the mantle. The clock adds an antique charm and a sense of timelessness to the room. Position it centrally to maintain balance and to add a focal point to the east wall.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Display the Abstract Painting on the South Wall</h3>
    <p>Hang a striking abstract painting in subtle pastel tones on the south wall. The painting will draw attention and inject the space with creative energy. Its placement is crucial to maintain the artistic ambiance and emotional depth of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Mount the Ornate Mirror Above a Console Table</h3>
    <p>Place an ornate mirror in an elegant frame above a small console table. Position it near the entrance or along the hallway. The mirror not only adds sophistication but also reflects light, making the room feel more spacious and inviting.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Final Touch – Place the Ambient Floor Lamp in the Reading Nook</h3>
    <p>Finish your design by placing a soft, ambient floor lamp in the designated reading nook. The gentle glow from the lamp will create a relaxing atmosphere, perfect for quiet moments. This final touch completes the room, ensuring every corner is thoughtfully curated.</p>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precision Matters:</strong> Every item needs to be carefully placed to ensure the room feels balanced and harmonious. Take your time with the positioning of each object.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Overcrowding:</strong> While each item carries its own story, avoid cluttering the space. The room should feel open and inviting, with enough space for movement.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear Pathways:</strong> Ensure that pathways remain open. In Dreamy Room Level 74, function and flow are just as important as aesthetics.</li>
      <li><strong>Lighting and Shadow:</strong> Reassess how the natural light interacts with your objects. Make adjustments as necessary to ensure the lighting complements the room's mood.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subtle Adjustments:</strong> A slight shift in object placement can significantly change the vibe of the room. Experiment with different arrangements until it feels just right.</li>

    <h3>Step 1: Hang the Elegant Sheer Curtains on the North Wall</h3>

    <h3>Step 3: Place the Vintage Armchair in the Upper Left Corner</h3>
    <p>Add a vintage tufted armchair to the upper left corner near the window. This creates a cozy reading nook while contributing to the nostalgic atmosphere of Dreamy Room Level 75.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Align the Classic Bookshelf Along the East Wall</h3>
    <p>Position a wooden bookshelf against the east wall. Fill it with books and mementos to tell your personal story and add depth to the room’s overall narrative.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Center the Sleek Coffee Table in the Middle of the Room</h3>
    <p>Place a glass-top coffee table at the center of the room, anchoring the seating area. This table helps maintain balanced symmetry in the room’s design.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Spread the Plush Area Rug Underneath the Coffee Table</h3>

    <h3>Step 12: Apply the Final Touches and Personalize the Space</h3>
    <p>Scatter personal artifacts throughout the room—such as a wall clock above the desk, a decorative vase on the coffee table, and small art pieces on secondary walls. These subtle accents complete the room’s design, ensuring every object is thoughtfully placed.</p>

    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 78! In this walkthrough, we'll guide you through each step to transform your hexagonal room into a pastel boutique with perfect furniture and decor arrangements.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Staircase Against the Left-Side Wall Support Post</h3>

    <h3>Step 4: Install the Purse-and-Shoe Display Shelf Against the Left Back Wall</h3>
    <p>Place the purse-and-shoe display shelf along the left back wall. Arrange the pastel purses and matching shoes on the tiers to complete this stylish display.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Place the Rectangular Hat Display Table at Center-Left</h3>
    <p>Position the rectangular hat display table at the center-left of the floor. Arrange the eight hat-lined stands in a neat row, with hats in pastel shades of yellow, green, and pink.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Position the Round Platform in the Center of the Floor</h3>
    <p>Place the round platform at the center of the floor and position the blue-and-white dress mannequin on top. This piece will serve as the centerpiece of the boutique.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Place the Long Tufted Bench on the Lower Right Side</h3>
    <p>Position the tufted bench on the lower right side of the room, facing the display area. This creates a cozy seating area for virtual customers.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Add the Right-Side Display Counter Against the Wall</h3>

    <h3>Step 9: Position the Jewelry Display Table Under the Mezzanine</h3>
    <p>Set the jewelry display table under the mezzanine and arrange the six busts with necklaces and the small jewelry box. This glimmering collection adds a touch of elegance to the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Attach the Curved Balcony Railing Along the Back Walls</h3>
    <p>Install the curved balcony railing along the back walls from left post to right post. This adds a cozy mezzanine level to the boutique.</p>

    <h3>Step 11: Place the Pink Chaise Lounge on the Mezzanine Floor</h3>
    <p>Place the pink chaise lounge near the left railing on the mezzanine floor. This is where virtual customers can relax and enjoy the boutique's atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 12: Set the Small Round Tufted Ottoman Beside the Chaise Lounge</h3>

    <h3>Step 13: Position the Round Tea Table Next to the Chaise Lounge</h3>
    <p>Place the round tea table next to the chaise lounge, and set the tea set, cake, and rose bouquet on top for a charming tea-time vignette.</p>

    <h3>Step 14: Add the Two White Flower Planters on Either Side of the Balcony</h3>
    <p>Place the two white flower planters on either side of the balcony railing to mirror the lower-floor planters for a balanced look.</p>

    <h3>Step 15: Install the Hexagonal Curtain Rod Above the Alcove</h3>
    <p>Install the hexagonal curtain rod above the back-center alcove and hang the pink curtain with bow to create a dressing room entrance.</p>

    <h3>Step 16: Place the Matching Hexagonal Mirror Inside the Alcove</h3>
    <p>Place the hexagonal mirror inside the alcove. This dimensional mirror reflects the boutique’s beautiful styling.</p>

    <h3>Step 17: Hang the Dark Blue Dress Behind the Curtain</h3>
    <p>Hang the dark blue dress behind the curtain in the alcove. This garment adds depth to the dressing area and enhances the boutique vibe.</p>

    <h3>Step 18: Set the Five Pastel-Colored Dress Mannequins Across the Right Shelf</h3>

    <h2>Dreamy Room Level 79 Walkthrough – Enchanting Garden Canopy</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 79! In this level, you'll be decorating an isometric platform with an enchanted garden canopy theme. Follow these detailed steps to create the magical, floral ambiance in this room.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Canopy Bed Under the Glass Dome</h3>
    <p>Start by positioning the purple canopy bed directly under the circular glass dome on the left side of the room. Make sure the bedframe legs align with the base of the dome for perfect placement.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Place the Purple Drapes on the Dome Supports</h3>
    <p>Attach the purple flowing drapes to the vertical supports of the dome, letting them hang evenly on all sides to create a cozy, luxurious canopy effect around the bed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Place the Pink Pillows on the Bed</h3>
    <p>Set the two heart-shaped pink pillows side by side at the head of the bed, just inside the canopy, for a cozy and inviting touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Place the Rose Vines Around the Dome Supports</h3>
    <p>Wrap the twisting white rose vines around each vertical pillar of the dome, spiraling them from the base to the top for a romantic and floral feel.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Place the Arched Vine Entry on the Right Wall</h3>
    <p>Position the white archway entwined with rose vines into the right alcove of the back wall, making sure it fits perfectly flush with the curve of the wall.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Place the Crystal Orb Stand in the Right Alcove</h3>
    <p>Drag the ornate metal stand with glowing green orbs into the center of the right alcove, placing it directly beneath the arched vine entry for added mystique.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Place the Chandelier Above the Crystal Orb Stand</h3>
    <p>Install the small gold chandelier with teal candles above the crystal orb stand. This lighting will add a magical glow to the room, enhancing the enchanted theme.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Place the Bunny Statue on the Green Pedestal</h3>
    <p>Place the white bunny statue wearing a purple cloak on the green circular pedestal in front of the orb stand, facing it for a whimsical touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Place the Pedestal Table with the Snake Figurine Next to the Bunny Statue</h3>
    <p>Position the small white pedestal table to the bunny’s right and set the coiled green snake figurine on top to add a magical and mythical detail to the scene.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Place the Gold Harp to the Left of the Bed</h3>
    <p>Set the elegant gold harp beside the left leg of the canopy bed, angling it slightly toward the center of the room to create an inviting atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 11: Place the Green Chaise Lounge Against the Left Wall</h3>
    <p>Move the mint-green chaise lounge to sit flush against the left wall, leaving enough space in front for additional decor and furniture.</p>

    <h3>Step 12: Place the Purple Cushion on the Chaise Lounge</h3>
    <p>Add a small purple cushion to the right end of the chaise lounge for a pop of color and comfort.</p>

    <h3>Step 13: Place the Tea Set on the Round Side Table</h3>
    <p>Position the small round side table near the chaise lounge and set the white teapot, cup, and plate of treats on top for a charming tea-time vignette.</p>

    <h3>Step 14: Place the Clover-Shaped Stools Around the Tea Table</h3>
    <p>Arrange the three small green clover stools evenly around the tea table to create a cozy seating area perfect for relaxing and socializing.</p>

    <h3>Step 15: Place the Wall Sconces with Teal Candles on the Left Wall</h3>
    <p>Install two gold wall sconces, each with three flickering teal candles, on the left wall. These will flank the chaise lounge area for added warmth and light.</p>

    <h3>Step 16: Place the Picture Frames on the Left Wall</h3>
    <p>Hang the empty white picture frames in a staggered arrangement between the sconces and the chaise lounge for a creative and artsy touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 17: Place the Floor Candelabra with Teal Flames at the Front Left Corner</h3>
    <p>Position the tall floor candelabra with teal flames in the front left corner of the platform, ensuring the flames face inward for dramatic effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 18: Place the Stack of Books and Single Candle on the Front Platform</h3>
    <p>Stack the two green books near the center of the front platform, and place the single white candle on top for a literary and magical touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 19: Place the Lily Pond with Frog at the Front Center</h3>
    <p>Drag the lily pond feature with lily pads and the little green frog to the center of the front platform, just beyond the railing, for a serene and natural element.</p>

    <h3>Step 20: Place the White Railing and Staircase at the Veranda Edge</h3>
    <p>Add the white balustrade railing along the front edge of the platform, and snap the small curved staircase into the central gap to complete the scene.</p>

    <h3>Step 21: Place the Rose Vines Around the Railing and Arches</h3>
    <p>Use the remaining vine pieces to weave around the railing posts and the top of both arches, uniting the floral theme across the entire room.</p>

    <h3>Step 22: Place the Two Crows on Top of Each Arch</h3>
    <p>Finally, place one black crow figurine on the left dome arch and the other on the right entry arch to complete the enchanted garden look.</p>
