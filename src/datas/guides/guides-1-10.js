      <h3>Step 1: Place the Pink Bed with Bunny Ears in the Top-Right Corner</h3>

      <h3>Step 3: Add the Large Teddy Bear on the Right Side</h3>
      <p>Move the big teddy bear with a bow tie to the lower-right corner, maintaining visual balance while keeping it near the bed.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Arrange the Rocking Horse Near the Bed</h3>

      <p>Level 2 invites you to style a compact bathroom by placing furniture and fixtures in their ideal locations. Use this guide to ensure every object is perfectly arranged.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Position the Bathtub on the Center-Left</h3>
      <p>Begin by placing the bathtub slightly left of center, with its length parallel to the back wall. This setup makes room for plumbing connections and adjacent furnishings.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Install the Toilet in the Far Left Corner</h3>
      <p>Move the toilet into the bottom-left corner of the room. Keeping it near the tub helps maintain a logical and efficient bathroom layout.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Mount the Water Heater Above the Tub</h3>
      <p>Attach the water heater to the wall above the showerhead. Keep it elevated and aligned to avoid overlapping with other items.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Add the Ventilation Fan Above the Toilet</h3>
      <p>Install the fan above the toilet area to help with airflow and humidity. Center it on the left wall for a functional and symmetrical design.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Arrange the Sink and Mirror on the Right Wall</h3>
      <p>Place the sink near the right side, close to the door, and hang the mirror above it. This layout ensures practical access and visual balance.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Fit the Window with Curtains Behind the Tub</h3>
      <p>Mount the window on the back wall behind the bathtub, then add pink curtains. This touch softens the space and brings in natural light.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Decorate with Accessories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Toilet Paper & Shelf:</strong> Place a holder beside the toilet and add a small shelf with extra rolls above.</li>
        <li><strong>Bath Products:</strong> Line shampoo and soap along the bathtub's edge.</li>
        <li><strong>Playful Touches:</strong> Position the rubber duck on the plush dog inside the tub.</li>
        <li><strong>Towel Hamper:</strong> Place a basket with towels next to the sink.</li>
        <li><strong>Plant:</strong> Set a tall bamboo plant near the sink for a fresh look.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Lay Rugs, Mats, and Slippers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bath Mat:</strong> Spread a cozy mat in front of the tub.</li>
        <li><strong>Entry Doormat & Slippers:</strong> Add them near the door to finish the space.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the preview feature to test placements before finalizing.</li>
        <li>Group related items like bottles or towels for clarity and order.</li>
        <li>Utilize wall space to free up floor area.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure large fixtures are properly aligned before placing accessories.</li>
        <li>Double-check vertical placements like the heater and fan to avoid overlap.</li>
        <li>Leave breathing space between decor to avoid clutter.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>With these steps, you'll complete Dreamy Room Level 2 with a well-designed bathroom layout that's both practical and inviting. Happy decorating!</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Place the Executive Chair Behind the Desk</h3>
      <p>Move the cushioned office chair directly behind the desk, centered and slightly tucked under the desk for a polished look.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Set the "CEO" Nameplate on the Desk</h3>
      <p>Place the small "CEO" plaque at the front edge of the desk. This small detail adds to the professional atmosphere of the workspace.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Arrange the Laptop and Lamp on the Desk</h3>
      <p>Place the laptop near the center of the desk, and set the lamp on its right side. Ensure there's enough space to keep the desk tidy while maintaining function.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Add the Coffee Mug in Front of the Chair</h3>
      <p>Position the coffee mug in front of the chair, slightly to the right of the laptop. This adds a cozy, lived-in feel to the workspace.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Install the Bookshelf to the Right Wall</h3>
      <p>Place the bookshelf against the right wall behind the desk. Make sure it doesn't overlap with the air conditioner, leaving enough space between objects.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Place Books and Decorative Items on the Bookshelf</h3>
      <p>Fill the middle shelf with colorful books, and add a small decorative box on the top shelf. Keep these items neat and orderly for a clean, professional look.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Hang the Clock and Calendar on the Right Wall</h3>
      <p>Mount the round clock on the upper right wall, and hang the calendar just below it. These wall-mounted items help balance the room's layout.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 9: Mount the Air Conditioner Above the Bookshelf</h3>
      <p>Install the air conditioner in the top corner of the right wall, above the bookshelf. Be mindful that it doesn't block the clock or calendar.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Add Potted Plants and the Backpack</h3>
      <p>Place one potted plant with red flowers on the left corner of the desk, and a green plant on the floor in front of the desk. Position the backpack to the left side of the desk to complete the space.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 11: Lay Down the Round Rug</h3>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 4 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>In Dreamy Room Level 4, you'll create a cozy kitchen from scratch. The main challenge is placing each object in the perfect spot. Follow these steps to complete the scene.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Place the Fridge in the Left Corner</h3>
      <p>Position the large orange refrigerator against the left wall, flush with the corner. Make sure the fridge door faces inward. You can add colorful notes or magnets to the fridge door to make it feel more cheerful.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Install the Overhead Cabinets Above the Counter</h3>
      <p>Place the yellow overhead cabinets directly to the right of the fridge along the top portion of the wall. Proper alignment of the cabinets is crucial in this step as it sets the base for the kitchen setup.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Set the Counter, Sink, and Stove Beneath the Cabinets</h3>
      <p>Position a continuous counter beneath the cabinets, leaving space for a built-in sink in the center. Place a dish-drying rack to the right of the sink. On the far right side of the counter, set a stovetop with a frying pan. Accurate placement is key in this step, as the alignment affects how other objects fit.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Add the Window and Short Green Curtain</h3>
      <p>Install a small rectangular window above the sink and place a short green curtain on it. The window should align so there's enough wall space on the right for the utensils rack.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Hang the Utensils on the Right Wall</h3>
      <p>Hang the cooking utensils rack on the right wall, beside the window. Include items like a spatula, ladle, and frying pan or pot lid. This step adds realism to the kitchen and maximizes the use of available wall space.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Position the Table and Tablecloth in the Center</h3>
      <p>Place a rectangular table with a white or cream-colored tablecloth in the center of the room. Ensure there is enough space on all sides of the table for easy movement and interaction.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Arrange the Bowls and Serving Dishes on the Table</h3>
      <p>On top of the table, place several bowls, a large serving dish, and any additional tableware. This step completes the cooking and dining theme of the level.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Include the Bunny Character (Optional Decoration)</h3>
      <p>Add the pink bunny character or plush in front of the table, holding a spatula. While not required for completion, it brings the room to life and adds a whimsical touch.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 9: Place the Rice Cooker (or Teapot) and Plant on the Right Side</h3>
      <p>Position a small counter or stand next to the stove area and place a rice cooker or teapot on top. Add a potted plant beside or below it, close to the window, to enhance the natural décor.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Final Touches: Rugs, Floor Mats, and Tiny Details</h3>
      <p>Place a small rug or mat in front of the sink to match the color scheme. Optionally, add a second mat near the entrance. Carefully double-check each item's placement to ensure everything is perfectly aligned for a flawless finish.</p>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Preview the layout before finalizing placement to ensure everything fits properly.</li>
        <li>Rotate items when necessary to improve alignment in tight spaces.</li>
        <li>Utilize the grid or snapping feature in the game to avoid uneven gaps between objects.</li>
        <li>Decorate in layers—start with large items like the fridge and cabinets, and finish with smaller décor for a smooth experience.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure precise alignment, particularly with the sink and stove, to avoid blocking space for other objects.</li>
        <li>Avoid overlapping objects like the fridge and cabinets as this can disrupt the placement process.</li>
        <li>Install cabinets before adding the counter and sink to maintain proper alignment.</li>
        <li>Save your progress frequently to avoid losing your layout.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following this detailed walkthrough, you'll successfully design a cozy, well-organized kitchen. Take your time, and enjoy transforming the empty room into a warm cooking space filled with charm!</p>

      <p>Put the circular coffee table at the center of the rug. Top it with an open book to evoke a relaxing, homey vibe.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Add the Hamster Occupant Plush</h3>
      <p>Place the hamster plush just in front of the coffee table. It adds character and a touch of playful charm to the room.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Mount the TV on the Right Wall</h3>
      <p>Mount the TV on the right wall at eye level. Proper placement here helps balance the layout.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Slide in the Pink TV Stand and Console</h3>
      <p>Place the pink TV stand directly under the mounted TV, and put the game console on top. This forms your entertainment center.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Place the Fridge in the Far-Right Corner</h3>
      <p>Move the small fridge to the far-right corner. This helps maximize space while preserving an organized aesthetic.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 9: Arrange Potted Plants Around the Room</h3>
      <p>Distribute plants in the following locations: one near the sofa, one by the glass door, and some on shelves. These add calm, natural energy to the room.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Hang the Clock and Small Bookshelf</h3>
      <p>Mount a wall clock above the TV and place a small bookshelf to its left. This completes the design of the right wall.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 11: Lean the Pink Shelf Next to the TV Stand</h3>
      <p>Place the pink leaning shelf between the TV stand and the door. Add a small plant to its top shelf for visual height and greenery.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 12: Decorate the Balcony Shelf with Plants</h3>
      <p>Use a tiered shelf with plants on the balcony area. This final touch enhances the tranquil atmosphere and visually finishes the scene.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure all items are precisely aligned—overlaps can prevent level completion.</li>
        <li>Keep the sofa facing the coffee table for a practical and aesthetic arrangement.</li>
        <li>Give the fridge enough room to avoid blocking the path or doors.</li>
        <li>If the hamster plush feels off-center, nudge the coffee table to adjust.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Zoom in and rotate pieces to fine-tune placement.</li>
        <li>Group related items like the TV, stand, and console for a cohesive setup.</li>
        <li>Stick to soft pastel colors for a harmonious look.</li>
        <li>Don’t hesitate to rearrange—experimenting helps you find the perfect fit.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following this walkthrough, you'll turn the room into a charming, pastel-toned living space. Enjoy every step as you bring your dream design to life in Dreamy Room Level 5!</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 6 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>This guide will walk you through transforming Dreamy Room Level 6 into a cozy, pet-friendly space with a perfect mix of comfort and function. Follow each step to recreate the final look with precision.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Position the Fish Tank in the Left Corner</h3>
      <p>Place the large fish tank flush against the left wall on the lower level. It sets the tone for the lower workspace and provides room for the desk setup.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Set Up the Desk in the Center</h3>
      <p>Move the wooden desk to the center-lower area. It should be evenly spaced to allow for surrounding furniture and decorations.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Arrange the Desk Items</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Open book – left side of the desk</li>
        <li>Laptop – centered</li>
        <li>Coffee mug – near the right corner</li>
        <li>Phone/calculator – behind the mug</li>
        <li>Cat bed with sleeping cat – far right end of the desk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This detailed desk setup creates a cozy, lived-in feel.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Add the Green Chair Behind the Desk</h3>
      <p>Slide the green chair behind the desk, facing the laptop to complete the functional work area.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Place the Small Round Rug to the Right</h3>
      <p>Position the rug to the right of the desk to define the zone near the shelf area and soften the space.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Install the Step Platform</h3>
      <p>Align the step or ramp leading up to the elevated area. Smooth alignment is essential for visual flow and gameplay triggers.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Set the Shelf in the Right Corner</h3>
      <p>Against the right wall on the lower level, place the tall shelf. It often holds pet food or supplies.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Furnish the Upper Platform with the Green Armchair</h3>
      <p>Move to the upper area and place the green armchair slightly facing the entertainment wall. This anchors the lounging space.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 9: Position the Round Side Table with the Pink Dessert</h3>
      <p>In front of the armchair, place the round table and top it with a pink dessert. This adds a relaxing, cozy vibe.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Place the Pet Character on the Armchair</h3>
      <p>Put the pet on the armchair—it’ll show a heart if correctly placed. This is one of Dreamy Room Level 6's signature moments!</p>
  
      <h3>Step 11: Mount the TV Screen and Console</h3>
      <p>On the upper wall, mount the “Game Over” TV and set the gaming console just below to form your entertainment nook.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 12: Add the Bookshelf on the Far Right</h3>
      <p>Finally, place the bookshelf in the upper-right corner. It provides visual weight and balances the upper floor design.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Precise alignment</strong> is key. Items won’t snap in if off by even a little.</li>
        <li>Ensure the step platform connects cleanly to the upper floor.</li>
        <li>Leave space between the desk and tank to avoid overlap.</li>
        <li>Make sure the fish tank is flush with the wall for optimal placement.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use grid view (if available) to align furniture precisely.</li>
        <li>Let item snapping guide correct placements.</li>
        <li>Start with the largest objects first, then layer in details.</li>
        <li>Don’t hesitate to rotate or try alternate angles—experimentation pays off.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following this walkthrough, you'll complete Dreamy Room Level 6 with ease. The space transforms into a playful, relaxing retreat for both work and leisure!</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Install the Green Wall and Window</h3>
      <p>Place the tall green-accented wall in the back-left corner and attach the smaller wall with the centered arched window to its right.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Position the Floor Tiles</h3>

      <h3>Step 3: Mount the “Coffee” Sign</h3>

      <h3>Step 7: Add the Bear Barista Figure</h3>

      <h3>Step 8: Install the Cash Register</h3>

      <h3>Step 9: Arrange the Coffee Machines and Blender</h3>
      <p>Line up the coffee machine, grinder, and blender on the back counter from left to right. This efficient layout helps simulate a real working café.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Stack the Cups and Containers</h3>

      <h3>Step 13: Set Up the Outdoor Seating</h3>
      <p>Place round tables and chairs on the untiled sidewalk area in front of the café. Leave space between them for ease of movement.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 14: Place the Street Lamp</h3>
      <p>Attach the tall street lamp to the right edge of the outer base. It adds charm and evening ambiance.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>

      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Preview item positions before placing to avoid crowding.</li>
        <li>Use grid view for better alignment.</li>
        <li>Group functional items together (e.g., all coffee tools behind the counter).</li>
        <li>Place the street lamp early for lighting references.</li>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 8 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>This detailed guide walks you through transforming a messy dental room into a clean, well-organized clinic. Dreamy Room Level 8 is all about perfect placement and alignment—follow each step carefully!</p>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Clear the Floor</h3>
      <p>Remove all trash like syringes, wrappers, and cotton swabs from the floor. This gives you a clean canvas for decoration and arrangement.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Position the Dental Chair</h3>
      <p>Place the main dental chair in the center of the room. This positioning allows plenty of space for both dentist and patient.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Seat the Dentist and Patient</h3>
      <p>Seat the pig patient in the chair, then position the pig dentist behind them, facing forward. Alignment of characters is essential to completing the scene correctly.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Install the Overhead Lamp</h3>
      <p>Attach the overhead dental lamp above the chair and ensure it's centered on the patient's face to replicate a realistic examination setting.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Add the Upper Storage Shelf and Tooth Model</h3>
      <p>Mount the shelf on the right wall and place the tooth plush or model on it. These decorations reinforce the dental theme of the level.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Organize the Towels and Supplies</h3>
      <p>Neatly fold and stack towels beneath the shelf. Line up dental supply jars beside them to keep everything clean and accessible.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Hang the Potted Plant</h3>
      <p>Hang a small potted plant in the top-right corner for a fresh, calming touch.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Set Up the Cabinet, Sink, and Trash Bin</h3>
      <p>Install the sink and cabinet along the left wall. Place the trash bin near the sink in the corner for easy access and realism.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 9: Attach the Air Conditioner and Window Blinds</h3>
      <p>Place the air conditioner above the left-side window and hang the blinds directly below it to complete the top wall setup.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Place the Cradle and Floor Mat</h3>
      <p>In the bottom-right area, add the baby cradle or bed, then position a floor mat near the door to complete the cozy clinic design.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Double-check object alignment:</strong> Misplacements may prevent level completion.</li>
        <li><strong>Let objects “snap” into place:</strong> Items may auto-align when you’re close to the correct spot.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the space clear:</strong> Avoid mixing trash with decorative elements during setup.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zoom in:</strong> Use the zoom tool for precision, especially when placing small objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Work in zones:</strong> Focus on one area at a time (chair area, shelf, sink) to avoid confusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for visual cues:</strong> Items glow or highlight slightly when near the right location—use this to your advantage.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>With these tips and the walkthrough above, you’ll transform Dreamy Room Level 8 into a pristine dental office, ready to welcome animal patients in style. Enjoy the satisfying results of careful placement!</p>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 9 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 9! In this level, you’ll transform a plain corner into a chic and whimsical makeup room. Follow these steps for perfect item placement and a beautiful final look.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Lay the Round Pink Rug</h3>
      <p>Place the round pink rug at the center of the room. It sets the tone for the layout and defines the space you’ll be decorating.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Position the Wooden Step</h3>
      <p>Ensure the small wooden step at the room’s entrance is properly aligned. It defines the entry point and should sit flush against the floor threshold.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Set Up the Partition with Hanging Vines</h3>
      <p>Place the tall white partition in the back-left corner and drape it with hanging vines. This separates the vanity area and adds a natural, calming touch.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Place the Vanity Table and Mirror</h3>
      <p>Against the left wall, position the vanity table with a large bulb-lit mirror. Don’t forget the pink bow on top—it adds charm and completes the vanity look.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 5: Organize the Makeup Items</h3>
      <p>Neatly arrange makeup products—eyeshadow, blush, brushes, and lipsticks—on the vanity table. Ensure each item is spaced clearly and visibly.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 6: Add the Heart-Shaped Stool</h3>
      <p>Slide the pink heart stool directly in front of the vanity. Face the heart outward to match the room’s aesthetic and ensure character interaction.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 7: Hang Clothes and Accessories</h3>
      <p>On the right side of the partition, install wall hooks and hang a pastel shirt, towel, and green bag. Neatly display each item without overlapping.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 8: Position the Clothing Rack and Shoes</h3>
      <p>In the room’s center, place the clothing rack with a red gown and other garments. Line up shoes—flats, slippers, and sandals—neatly below the rack.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 9: Arrange Shopping Bags and Plants</h3>
      <p>Place two “Dreamy” shopping bags near the rug. Add one large plant on the left and a smaller one on the right for a natural decorative balance.</p>
  
      <h3>Step 10: Add the Heart Chair and Character Figure</h3>
      <p>Set the pink heart chair by the right wall, near the window. Finally, position the red-dressed cat character figure in the center, holding a checklist or paper.</p>
  
      <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check for snap effects:</strong> Items may glow when near the correct spot.</li>
        <li><strong>Mind wall alignment:</strong> Some objects must sit flush against the wall.</li>

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 10 Walkthrough & Guide</h2>
      <p>Dreamy Room Level 10 invites you to design a cozy pig-themed bedroom with meticulous detail. Follow this walkthrough to recreate the room exactly as shown in the finished layout.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Step 1: Position the Bed in the Right Corner</h3>
      <p>Place the green bed in the back-right corner of the room. The headboard should sit just below the window, aligned with the angled wall.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Step 2: Add the Window with Green Curtains</h3>
      <p>Mount the window directly above the bed. Ensure the green curtains are evenly placed and centered to frame the bed nicely.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Step 3: Arrange the Closet and Top Compartment</h3>
      <p>Place the tall wooden closet next to the bed’s right side. On top of it, stack the storage compartment. Both must be aligned neatly for the layout to register as correct.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Step 4: Place the Desk and Chair</h3>
      <p>Move to the left side and position the desk facing the bed. Slide the chair under the desk, leaving enough walkway space between the bed and desk.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Step 5: Add the Shelf, Books, and Pig Figurine</h3>
      <p>Above the desk, attach the small wall shelf. Place three books (in different heights) and a pig figurine to the left of them to keep the pig theme going.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Step 6: Install the Air Conditioner and Wall Clock</h3>
      <p>Mount the air conditioner high on the left wall. Then add the round wall clock near the center top, just above the shelf.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Step 7: Set Up the Nightstand, Lamp, and Digital Clock</h3>
      <p>Place the nightstand to the bed’s left side. Put the lamp and digital clock (showing 20:34) on top, facing forward for visibility.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Step 8: Arrange the Pig Plushies</h3>
      <p>Place the larger pig plush in the center of the bed and stack the smaller one behind it. These plushies are key to the level’s theme.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Step 9: Decorate the Floor and Add the Telescope</h3>
      <p>Lay the pig-shaped slipper rug beside the bed. Place the telescope near the bottom-left corner, angled outward as if pointed to the sky.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Step 10: Position the Mirror, Record Player, and Mini Garden</h3>
      <p>Set the tall mirror near the closet. Next to it, add the small round table with the record player. Near the bottom edge of the room, place the mini garden with a potted plant and a pastry on display.</p>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Notes and Precautions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Object Locking:</strong> Some items snap into place and can be difficult to move afterward—check placement carefully first.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Overlaps:</strong> Ensure objects do not block each other to prevent misalignment errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Coordination:</strong> The green and pink color palette is intentional—maintain balance for proper theme alignment.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Dreamy Room Level 10 Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Preview Mode:</strong> This helps you verify item alignment before finalizing.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate When Needed:</strong> Some furniture can be rotated—experiment to find the best fit.</li>
        <li><strong>Group Thematic Items:</strong> Keep pig-themed items close together for a cohesive look.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By following this guide, you’ll recreate the perfect pig-themed bedroom and complete Dreamy Room Level 10 with ease. Take your time, enjoy the decorating process, and watch your cozy space come to life!</p>
