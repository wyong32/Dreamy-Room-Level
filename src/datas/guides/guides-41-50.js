    <p>Welcome to the walkthrough for Dreamy Room Level 46! This guide walks you through each step to design a tranquil bedroom complete with a fireplace, tea corner, and elegant accents.</p>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>

    <h2>Step 1: Place the Bed in the Corner</h2>
    <p><strong>Sleeping Area:</strong> Start by positioning the bed against the teal-striped wall on the far right, near the window. Ensure the headboard is flush with the wall to anchor the layout.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Position the Fireplace</h2>
    <p><strong>Warmth & Balance:</strong> Place the cozy fireplace along the left teal wall, centered horizontally. This sets a welcoming tone and balances the bed’s placement.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Arrange the Rug and Sofa</h2>
    <p><strong>Seating Area:</strong> Roll out the red rug starting from the entrance. Place the sofa with throw pillows nearby, angled slightly toward the fireplace for a snug, conversational setup.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Set Up the Table and Tea Set</h2>
    <p><strong>Tea Corner:</strong> Put the round wooden table in front of the sofa and arrange a tea set with cups and treats on top. This adds charm and functionality.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Add the Cabinet and Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>Storage Zone:</strong> Place the tall cabinet beside the bed near the back window. Fill it with books, baskets, and other storage-friendly décor.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Window Treatment and Decor</h2>
    <p><strong>Elegant Drapery:</strong> Hang maroon curtains over the window. Ensure they fall evenly and complement the surrounding colors.</p>

    <h2>Step 7: Place Decorative Items</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Above the Bed:</strong> Mount a portrait and mirror.</li>
      <li><strong>On the Fireplace:</strong> Place decorative clocks.</li>
      <li><strong>On the Sofa:</strong> Add plush cushions.</li>
      <li><strong>Near the Cabinet:</strong> Position leafy potted plants.</li>
      <li><strong>Near the Sofa:</strong> Add a soft ottoman for extra seating.</li>
      <li><strong>Additional Decor:</strong> Place a globe and trinkets on open surfaces like the table and cabinet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Furniture Alignment:</strong> Make sure large pieces are flush with walls and not floating awkwardly in space.</li>

      <li><strong>No Timer:</strong> Dreamy Room encourages relaxation—take your time and get each detail just right.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start with Large Objects:</strong> Bed, fireplace, and cabinet form the structure of the room.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Decor Wisely:</strong> Fill in empty spaces without cluttering; each item should enhance the mood.</li>
      <li><strong>Frame Views:</strong> Curtains and wall art add vertical interest and help “frame” your room.</li>
      <li><strong>Check Every Angle:</strong> Zoom out and rotate to spot misalignments and missed placements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Dreamy Room Level 47 invites players to craft a cozy and imaginative mobile home set against a serene desert backdrop. Follow this step-by-step walkthrough to place each item perfectly.</p>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>

    <h2>Step 1: Place the Mobile Home</h2>
    <p><strong>Foundational Placement:</strong> Start by positioning the mobile home on the left side of the platform, nestled into the back-left corner. This sets the structure for the rest of the design.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Install Windows and Curtains</h2>
    <p><strong>Natural Light:</strong> Add wide windows and flowy blue curtains along the side walls of the mobile home to let sunlight pour in and create a soft, airy feel.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Arrange Bedroom Furniture</h2>
    <p><strong>Sleeping Nook:</strong> Inside the mobile home, place the bed and pillows near the center to establish a peaceful resting space central to the room’s design.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Set Up Rooftop Elements</h2>
    <p><strong>Rooftop Vibe:</strong> Add a satellite dish toward the front and a small pool to the back of the mobile home's roof. Don’t forget the side ladder that leads up to this relaxing rooftop escape.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Decorate the Kitchen Area</h2>
    <p><strong>Cozy Cooking:</strong> On the right wall, mount open shelves with bottles, a clock, and storage. Below, install counters, a stove, and a sink to complete the mini kitchen.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Position the Dining Table</h2>
    <p><strong>Dining Comfort:</strong> Place a small dining table with a pie centerpiece in front of the kitchen. Arrange chairs around it to create a simple yet welcoming eating space.</p>

    <h2>Step 7: Arrange the Living Room Furniture</h2>
    <p><strong>Vintage Lounge:</strong> Opposite the kitchen, position a sofa, armchair, and coffee table. Surround them with smaller chairs and an antique-style TV set for a nostalgic vibe.</p>

    <h2>Step 8: Add Decorative Plants and Outdoor Furniture</h2>
    <p><strong>Desert Flair:</strong> Decorate the outside of the mobile home with cactus plants, pots, and succulents. Add lounge chairs and outdoor accessories for a sun-drenched relaxation spot.</p>

    <h2>Step 9: Finish with Small Decorative Touches</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add teapots and cups to kitchen shelves and tables.</li>
      <li>Place books and reading lamps inside the living area.</li>
      <li>Use tiny accessories to fill remaining gaps without overcrowding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Snap-to-Place:</strong> Listen for a subtle “click” when items are correctly positioned.</li>
      <li><strong>Check Object Overlaps:</strong> Ensure nothing blocks other items or pathways.</li>
      <li><strong>Time-Free Gameplay:</strong> No rush—take your time to perfect the setup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Group by Category:</strong> Place all plants, furniture, or cookware together first to simplify arrangement.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow Background Cues:</strong> The environment often hints at where items should go.</li>
      <li><strong>Balance the Layout:</strong> Distribute furniture and decorations evenly to avoid clutter or empty corners.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enjoy your peaceful journey in Dreamy Room Level 47, where every placement brings warmth and life to this charming mobile home in the desert.</p>

    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 50, a delightful stage where you transform a humble suitcase into a cozy living space. The main challenge is figuring out the precise placement of every item. Let’s dive in!</p>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h3>

    <h2>Step 1: Place the Bed in the Center</h2>
    <p>Begin by positioning the bed in the center of the suitcase. Make sure the headboard touches the left wall. This golden-yellow blanket bed becomes the focal point of your mini-home.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Position the Cat Character on the Bed</h2>
    <p>Place the small cat figure on top of the bedspread. It brings charm and warmth to the scene.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Hang the Teddy Bear in a Bubble Seat at the Top Left</h2>
    <p>Attach the bubble-style pink beanbag to the upper-left corner. Place the teddy bear inside to create a relaxing reading nook.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Arrange the Books and Shelves</h2>
    <p>Mount the small shelves with colorful books above or beside the teddy bear to complete the cozy top-left nook.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Add the Side Table and Lamp</h2>
    <p>Position a narrow table to the right of the bed and place a modern white lamp on top for nighttime ambiance.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Place the Fruit Tray and Additional Pillows</h2>
    <p>At the foot of the bed, place a tray with oranges and lemons along with extra pillows. It adds color and comfort.</p>

    <h2>Step 7: Set Up the Gaming Console on the Right</h2>
    <p>On the right wall or corner, set up a small shelf or surface with a gaming console and controller. This is your entertainment hub.</p>

    <h2>Step 8: Position the Ladder and Lock Mechanism</h2>
    <p>Place the miniature ladder along the right edge leading up. The suitcase’s front lock displays “9999”—ignore this puzzle for now, as object placement takes priority.</p>

    <h3>Notes and Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Check Object Placement:</strong> Small shifts can prevent success. Match item locations with the final scene exactly.</li>
      <li><strong>Mind the Space:</strong> Don’t crowd items—leave walking room between bed, table, and walls.</li>
      <li><strong>Ignore Puzzle Elements Initially:</strong> Focus on decor placement before addressing any code or lock clues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use the Clue Note:</strong> “12n4” might mean something later, but don’t let it distract from decorating now.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotate for Fit:</strong> Some furniture may need to be turned slightly—experiment to see what matches the preview.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Items Logically:</strong> Keep books in the same area and pillows near the bed for realism and flow.</li>
      <li><strong>Get Inspired:</strong> Revisit earlier suitcase levels for layout ideas and reference.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following this walkthrough, you'll perfectly recreate the cozy vibe of Dreamy Room Level 50. Enjoy turning your suitcase into a peaceful and playful retreat!</p>
