    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 31: Ghostly Garden Bedroom</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 31, one of the most charming stages in the game! In this level, you’ll decorate a tranquil bedroom with lush greenery, a comfortable workspace, and adorable ghost-like plushies. The main challenge is placing each item in its perfect spot. Let’s dive in!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Bed in the Back-Right Corner</h3>
    <p>Start by placing the bed against the right wall, near the back corner. The headboard should rest flush against the wall, with the foot facing the room center. This forms your sleeping nook.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Desk in the Back-Left Corner</h3>
    <p>Place the desk parallel to the bed along the left wall, near the back corner. This creates a cozy, functional workspace and balances the layout.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Desk Chair in Front of the Desk</h3>
    <p>Position the chair directly in front of the desk. Make sure it aligns naturally for interaction with the computer setup.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Hang the Wall Lamp Above the Desk</h3>
    <p>Mount the wall lamp above the desk. Adjust the height to brighten the desk area evenly without harsh shadows.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Attach the Large Trailing Vine on the Ceiling</h3>
    <p>Place the long vine across the ceiling near the back wall. Let it drape gently above the desk and bed for a lush, cohesive look.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Place the Bookshelf Behind the Bed</h3>
    <p>Slot the bookshelf directly behind the bed. Fill it with books to add color and charm. Ensure it doesn’t interfere with the bed’s headboard.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Arrange the Three Framed Pictures on the Right Wall</h3>
    <p>Hang the three framed pictures above the pillows on the right wall. They tie the room’s style together with visual flair.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Add the Cacti and Potted Plants Throughout the Room</h3>
    <p>Distribute plants for a vibrant aesthetic: place small cacti near the bed, a trailing plant on the desk, and a larger plant in the left corner by the desk.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Install the Glass Railing at the Front Edge</h3>
    <p>Position the glass barrier along the front edge of the room. It defines the room’s boundary without obstructing your view.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Add the Adorable Ghost-Like Plushies</h3>
    <p>Place one plushie on the bed, one on the floor near the glass railing, and one perched atop the ceiling vine. These cute characters are the final whimsical touch.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Check placement precision:</strong> Each object must snap into place correctly or it may block other items.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid overlapping:</strong> Especially with ceiling vines and tall furniture like the bookshelf.</li>
      <li><strong>Lighting matters:</strong> Improper lamp placement can create awkward shadows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start big:</strong> Place large furniture first (bed, desk, bookshelf) before fine-tuning the smaller elements.</li>
      <li><strong>Zoom in:</strong> Use the in-game zoom to carefully position decor and wall elements.</li>
      <li><strong>Group greenery:</strong> Concentrate plants in corners for a natural, lived-in feel.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotate when needed:</strong> If something looks off, rotate it slightly to improve alignment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following these instructions, you’ll successfully complete Dreamy Room Level 31 and create a peaceful sanctuary brimming with greenery, warmth, and playful ghost plushies. Enjoy your new space!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 32: Cozy Café Corner</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 32! In this level, you’ll transform a bare corner with pink-striped walls into a vibrant café. From placing the counter to decorating tables and seating your pink bunny mascot, every detail counts. Follow this guide to recreate the perfect layout!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Mount the Exterior Sign</h3>
    <p>Attach the circular, drumstick-shaped sign to the left wall near the corner. This red sign marks the café's entrance and sets the scene.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Main Counter</h3>
    <p>Place the long red counter along the top-left edge of the room, flush against the striped wall. This counter will house appliances and the cash register.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Arrange the Cooking Appliances</h3>
    <p>Set the fryer and coffee machine on the left side of the counter. Then add the microwave or oven in the center. Ensure they fit side-by-side neatly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Cash Register and Display Case</h3>
    <p>Install the cash register slightly to the right of the counter’s front edge. Center the glass display case to showcase your food items like burgers and pastries.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Place the Refrigerator</h3>
    <p>Move to the back-right corner and place the fridge against the wall. It should sit neatly between the corner and the nearby plant’s space.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add the Decorative Plant</h3>
    <p>Place the green potted plant just to the left of the fridge. This adds natural charm without blocking access to the fridge.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Position the Tables and Chairs</h3>
    <p>Set two circular tables in the center of the room, each with two red-and-white chairs. Then align two more tables along the right wall with matching chairs. Keep enough space for walking paths.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Decorate the Tables</h3>
    <p>Add burgers, fries, drinks, and small condiments to the tables. Each table should look lively and unique to enhance the café's realism.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Place the Pink Bunny</h3>
    <p>Position the pink bunny figure near one of the center tables. It adds a playful, welcoming atmosphere. Avoid blocking chairs or walkways.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Final Touches</h3>
    <p>Double-check that everything is aligned—appliances on the counter, spacing around tables, and that nothing overlaps or blocks other items.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Collision Issues:</strong> Rotate items if they overlap, especially near walls or furniture.</li>
      <li><strong>Wall Alignment:</strong> Items like the counter and fridge must sit flush to the wall for a clean fit.</li>
      <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Ensure free movement around tables and the kitchen area.</li>
      <li><strong>Save Progress:</strong> Save often to avoid losing your ideal arrangement if you make a mistake.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use Overhead View:</strong> This helps align tables, chairs, and appliances with greater precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Items (if available):</strong> Moving tables and chairs together ensures better spacing.</li>
      <li><strong>Align to Patterns:</strong> Use the striped walls and checkered floor as visual guides.</li>
      <li><strong>Balance Décor:</strong> Spread out cups and condiments to make the café feel lived-in but not messy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following these detailed instructions, you’ll complete Dreamy Room Level 32 and bring your adorable café to life. Enjoy the cozy, welcoming vibe and take pride in your delicious design!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 33: Pirate Cat Ship</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 33, where you turn a plain wooden ship deck into a whimsical pirate-cat adventure! This level is full of nautical charm and adorable feline flair. Use this step-by-step walkthrough to perfectly place every item and bring the ship to life.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Position the Cat-Shaped Figurehead at the Bow</h3>
    <p>Begin by placing the cat-shaped figurehead at the ship's front. This sets the tone for your cozy cat-pirate aesthetic.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Attach the Anchor on the Left Side</h3>
    <p>Hang the anchor from the left hull using paw-shaped brackets. It enhances the ship’s authenticity and completes the outer look.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Raise the Front Mast and Sail</h3>
    <p>Place the front mast and attach the large cream-colored sail. Align it with the cat figurehead to unlock placement of later items.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Place the Second Mast and Pirate Flag</h3>
    <p>Set the second mast behind the first and mount the skull-and-crossbones flag facing outward. Visibility matters!</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Crows Nest Occupant</h3>
    <p>Put the red-hatted pirate figure in the crows nest atop the front mast. It brings life and storytelling to your ship setup.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Set Up the Steering Wheel</h3>
    <p>Place the wooden wheel at the rear platform. It should be centered to allow for surrounding items to fit properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Arrange the Table, Bookshelf, and Open Book</h3>
    <p>Place a small table behind the front mast, and place an open map or book on it. Add the bookshelf next to the table to create a pirate study nook.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Position the Seat and Treasure Chest</h3>
    <p>Place the cushioned seat near the table, then tuck the treasure chest near the back railing. Leave room for both the chest and the steering wheel to avoid crowding.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Secure Additional Decorative Elements</h3>
    <p>Place small crates, boxes, or figurines in empty corners—especially near the seat area. These fill out the room and improve your final score.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Item Locking:</strong> Correctly placed items usually lock into place. If not, reposition them.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Sails and flags need proper alignment or you may be blocked from placing later pieces.</li>
      <li><strong>Collision Warnings:</strong> Make sure the table, chest, and furniture aren’t overlapping key features.</li>
      <li><strong>Save Progress:</strong> Save regularly to avoid redoing work in case of bugs or crashes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rotate Items:</strong> Use item rotation for more precise placement—especially for the masts and sails.</li>
      <li><strong>Zoom In:</strong> Get close to the action to fine-tune small items like the map or pirate figure.</li>
      <li><strong>Check Shadows:</strong> Shadows help guide where items belong on the deck.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Items:</strong> Keep books, maps, or crates together to simplify the layout process.</li>
      <li><strong>Experiment First:</strong> Try placing items freely—Dreamy Room Level 33 encourages a bit of trial and error!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Congratulations! You’ve completed Dreamy Room Level 33 and brought a delightful pirate-cat ship to life. Enjoy the cozy sailing vibes and all your hard decorating work!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 34: Floral Bedroom</h2>
    <p>Transform the empty space into a tranquil pastel retreat in Dreamy Room Level 34. This floral-themed room is filled with charm, soft colors, and cozy furnishings. Follow this guide step-by-step to recreate the lovely final layout.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Position the Bed in the Right Corner</h3>
    <p>Place the pastel bed snugly against the right wall. Make sure the rounded edge faces outward to leave enough space in front.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Large Flower Pillow on the Bed</h3>
    <p>Place the oversized yellow flower pillow in the center of the bed. It serves as a visual highlight of the design.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Set the Teddy Bear Near the Bed</h3>
    <p>Position the teddy bear with a flower hat to the left of the bed, close to the round table area for a cozy touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Arrange the Small Round Table in Front</h3>
    <p>Set the round table slightly to the left in front of the bed. This table acts as the central point for desserts and décor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Place the Slice of Cake on the Table</h3>
    <p>Place a slice of cake at the center of the round table. It adds a sweet, homey detail to the room’s layout.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Position the Desk and Chair Along the Back Wall</h3>
    <p>Install the desk and chair on the right side of the back wall, leaving room to walk between the bed and workspace.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Add the Mirror Above the Desk</h3>
    <p>Place the oval mirror directly above the desk. It reflects the room’s floral charm and completes the wall arrangement.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Hang Potted Plants and Flowers</h3>
    <p>Hang pink and white potted plants along the left wall and above the window area. They create a soft garden-like atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Decorate the Walls with Floral Art</h3>
    <p>Place framed flower paintings between the mirror and window. This art connects the color scheme and floral elements.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Final Touches – Add Extra Flower Pots</h3>
    <p>Scatter smaller flower pots throughout the room—on the desk, on the round table, and near the bed. These final details enhance the cozy vibe and complete the space.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Check Object Placement:</strong> Each item has a precise position. Misplacing just one might block level completion.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Overcrowding:</strong> Leave walking space so your arrangement doesn’t look cluttered or cause alignment issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Mind the Walls:</strong> When placing hanging plants, align them with wall edges, window borders, or decorative ledges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Zoom In:</strong> Use zoom to accurately place smaller objects like flower pots or dessert plates.</li>
      <li><strong>Try Different Angles:</strong> Rotate the view (if available) to better align paintings and potted décor.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow Color Clues:</strong> Match objects by color—pink and green tones often indicate correct zones in this level.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With careful placement and attention to pastel color cues, you'll recreate a serene floral paradise in Dreamy Room Level 34. Enjoy designing this beautiful and calming room!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 35: Rocket Treehouse</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 35, you’ll build a rocket-themed treehouse filled with imagination and comfort. Follow each of the following steps to perfectly recreate this dreamy cosmic escape.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Position the Ladder Leading Up the Trunk</h3>
    <p>Start by placing the ladder against the tree trunk on the right side. Align the base with the floor and the top with the platform edge.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Attach the Swing Beneath the Right Branch</h3>
    <p>Hang the swing under the right-side tree branch, slightly off-center. It should not overlap with the rocket or block movement paths.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Place the Rocket on the Right Side of the Room</h3>
    <p>Secure the rocket near the front right edge of the platform. Make sure it stands tall with its base flat and nose angled upward.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Arrange the Curved Purple Sofa on the Left</h3>
    <p>Place the sofa on the left side, curving along the edge. Leave some breathing room between it and the trunk.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Set the Globe on the Small Side Table</h3>
    <p>Put the round table in front of the sofa and top it with the globe. This reinforces the space-travel theme and balances the layout.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add the Green Plant Beside the Sofa</h3>
    <p>Place a leafy plant to the left of the sofa to bring in a natural touch and add a pop of green.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Install the Desk and Computer in the Center</h3>
    <p>Set up a central workstation with a wooden desk, computer, and chair. This is the main hub of the treehouse.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Place the Star-Shaped Rug near the Desk</h3>
    <p>Lay down the star rug in front of the desk. It adds whimsy and unites the work and space themes.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Install the Bookshelf at the Back Wall</h3>
    <p>Place the bookshelf at the back wall, keeping it aligned and clutter-free. It adds character and storage.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Hang the Planetary Ornament at the Top Arch</h3>
    <p>Mount the planetary ornament or sun-like piece above the desk area. This glowing centerpiece completes the cosmic look.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Check Item Overlaps:</strong> Ensure the swing, rocket, and plant don’t overlap or hide one another.</li>
      <li><strong>Mind the Floor Curves:</strong> Position furniture flush with the treehouse’s rounded edges.</li>
      <li><strong>Ensure Visibility:</strong> Avoid crowding items like the globe and plant, so all details remain visible.</li>
      <li><strong>Watch the Ladder Clearance:</strong> Double-check that the ladder doesn’t clash with the rocket structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use Zoom:</strong> Zoom in to fine-tune placement of smaller objects like the swing and desk.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotate Objects:</strong> Slight object rotation can help fit them into curved areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Test Layouts:</strong> Try placing items in different spots for creativity before locking in the right answer.</li>
      <li><strong>Group by Theme:</strong> Keep space-related objects clustered to emphasize the level’s adventure theme.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With this walkthrough, you'll transform the empty treehouse into a dreamy rocket-themed retreat in Level 35. Take your time placing each piece, and soon you’ll launch into a cozy, star-filled sanctuary!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 36: Cozy Bathroom</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 36, you’ll decorate a hexagonal half-dome space into a fully functional and adorable bathroom. Every item has its place, and the challenge lies in perfect alignment and thoughtful spacing. Let’s get started!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Position the Sink and Mirror</h3>
    <p><strong>Sink:</strong> Place the sink cabinet in the lower-left corner, flush against the wall.</p>
    <p><strong>Mirror:</strong> Mount the round mirror directly above the sink, centered over the basin.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Hang the Fish Painting</h3>
    <p><strong>Placement:</strong> Hang the fish painting on the left wall, just above and behind the mirror for visual balance.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Install the Bathtub and Shower</h3>
    <p><strong>Bathtub:</strong> Center the tub in the room with space around it for accessories.</p>
    <p><strong>Shower Head:</strong> Mount it to the back wall, directly above the bathtub.</p>
    <p><strong>Shower Curtain:</strong> Hang the curtain so it drapes neatly over one side of the tub from a rod attached to the back wall.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Arrange the Rubber Ducks</h3>
    <p><strong>Ducks:</strong> Place one on the front rim and another at the back of the tub to add a playful vibe.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Lay Down the Bath Mat and Slippers</h3>
    <p><strong>Bath Mat:</strong> Place in front of the sink and partly in front of the tub.</p>
    <p><strong>Slippers:</strong> Set to the right of the mat, ready for use.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Place the Potted Plant</h3>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Front-left corner of the room, just in front of the sink cabinet, to add greenery and charm.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Add the Laundry Basket and Washing Machine</h3>
    <p><strong>Basket:</strong> Put the laundry basket in the lower-right corner.</p>
    <p><strong>Washing Machine:</strong> Place to the left of the basket, leaving a small gap for realism.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Organize the Shelves and Toiletries</h3>
    <p><strong>Wall Shelf:</strong> Install on the right wall above the washing machine.</p>
    <p><strong>Accessories:</strong> Stack towels and place bottles (shampoo, soap, lotion) neatly on the shelf. Add a basket if available.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Final Checks and Decorative Touches</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure all major fixtures are aligned to the walls.</li>
      <li>Add any remaining soaps or bottles on the sink or a tub caddy.</li>
      <li>Make final adjustments to the curtain so it doesn’t cover the mirror or painting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Room Shape:</strong> The hexagonal layout means you need to pay close attention to angles and spacing.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Overcrowding:</strong> Leave space between objects to prevent overlapping graphics.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotate Objects:</strong> Slight tweaks can help larger items sit better in corners.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer Awareness:</strong> If something disappears, try removing and re-adding it in the right order.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Place Large Objects First:</strong> Start with tub, sink, and washer to reserve necessary space.</li>
      <li><strong>Align with Walls:</strong> Use edges of the hexagonal room as guides.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Accessories:</strong> Cluster towels and bottles for a clean, realistic layout.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Check:</strong> Scan the room to ensure no object floats or looks out of place.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once you've followed all the steps above, you’ll have created a delightful bathroom setup in Dreamy Room Level 36. Enjoy the serene pastel tones and functionality of your design!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 37: Art Studio</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 37, you’re tasked with creating a whimsical art studio in a triangular space. The challenge lies in placing each object in its precise location to complete the cozy, creative atmosphere of the room.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the A-Frame Studio Structure</h3>
    <p><strong>A-Frame Structure:</strong> Start by placing the large wooden A-frame in the center of the room. This structure serves as the base of your art studio, complete with a triangular roof and an open front.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Cat Statue at the Apex</h3>
    <p><strong>Cat Statue:</strong> Place the small cat statue at the peak of the A-frame, right on the top beam. This whimsical touch adds charm to your art studio's exterior.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Hang the “Sloth Studio” Sign</h3>
    <p><strong>Sign Placement:</strong> Attach the “Sloth Studio” sign on the upper-left side of the A-frame's roof. Align it so that it’s visible, highlighting the studio’s artistic theme.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Arrange the Vines Around the Roof Edges</h3>
    <p><strong>Vines:</strong> Drape green vines along both sides of the A-frame, giving the studio a lush, natural atmosphere that complements its creative vibe.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Position the Shelf and Paint Jars</h3>
    <p><strong>Shelf Placement:</strong> Inside the upper portion of the A-frame, install a small wooden shelf near the window. Place the paint jars, brushes, and art supplies on this shelf to keep things organized.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Set Up the Sloth Characters</h3>
    <p><strong>Larger Sloth:</strong> Place the sloth character wearing a green hat and apron near the front easel.</p>
    <p><strong>Smaller Sloth:</strong> Position the smaller sloth with a pink bow slightly behind the first, next to a second easel or art station.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Place the Main Easel and Canvas</h3>
    <p><strong>Easel:</strong> Set the main easel in front of the larger sloth. Make sure the canvas with the sloth painting is clearly visible and facing outward.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Arrange the Central Table and Artwork</h3>
    <p><strong>Table:</strong> Place a small, round table in the center of the studio between the two sloths. Add a decorative vase or a small paint palette on top, along with other art pieces for visual interest.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Slide Out the Lower Storage Drawer</h3>
    <p><strong>Storage Drawer:</strong> At the base of the A-frame, pull out the built-in drawer to reveal extra storage. Place smaller accessories like paint tubes or brushes here for easy access.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Hang the Wooden Sloth Tag</h3>
    <p><strong>Sloth Tag:</strong> Attach the wooden sloth tag on the lower left corner of the studio’s exterior. This final touch completes the room and confirms the proper placement of every object.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Object Placement Sensitivity:</strong> Be sure to align each item correctly to avoid misplacement. Slight errors can prevent the room from being completed properly.</li>
      <li><strong>Fragile Decor:</strong> Decorations like the cat statue are delicate, so be careful when placing them.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Overcrowding:</strong> Don’t place too many items on the shelves, as this can cause issues with object stacking.</li>
      <li><strong>Check Angles:</strong> If an item doesn’t fit, try rotating it or adjusting the camera angle to make sure it aligns correctly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use the Outline:</strong> The game often provides faint outlines for certain objects, helping you determine where to place them.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Similar Items:</strong> Keep art supplies like brushes, jars, and tubes together for easier placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on Sloth Placement:</strong> The two sloths are central to this level. Once they’re positioned, the rest of the objects will naturally fall into place around them.</li>
      <li><strong>Utilize the Storage Drawer:</strong> Store smaller items in the pull-out drawer to clear up space for larger pieces before arranging everything.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By carefully following these steps, you’ll create the charming art studio seen in Dreamy Room Level 37. Enjoy crafting this cozy, whimsical space, and remember that every little detail counts!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 38: Pastel Bedroom</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 38, where you’ll recreate a cozy, pastel-themed bedroom. The room features a soft pink and purple color palette, plush toys, delicate furniture, and charming decorative accents. The key challenge is placing each object exactly in its designated spot. Follow the steps carefully to complete the level successfully.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Position the Bed Against the Back Wall</h3>
    <p><strong>Bed Placement:</strong> Start by placing the large bed with the frilly pink bedspread against the back wall. Center it so that it lines up with the window above. This placement ensures the bed is the focal point of the room and helps with the overall aesthetic.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Window and Curtains</h3>
    <p><strong>Window and Curtains:</strong> Install the window with pink drapes on the back wall, directly above the head of the bed. The curtains should hang evenly on both sides of the window frame for a balanced look.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Arrange the Divider Near the Bed</h3>
    <p><strong>Room Divider:</strong> Place the two-panel pink-and-white room divider to the left side of the bed. Angle it slightly to screen the bedside area, adding both privacy and aesthetic appeal to the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Set the Wardrobe to the Right</h3>
    <p><strong>Wardrobe Placement:</strong> Position the tall white wardrobe with gold accents on the right side of the bed. Ensure there is a small gap between the bed and the wardrobe, just like in the completed image.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Place the Teddy Bear and Pig Plush</h3>
    <p><strong>Plush Toys:</strong> On top of the wardrobe, place the large brown teddy bear and the smaller pink pig plush. The teddy bear should lean slightly against the wall, creating a charming focal point.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Position the Vanity Table and Chair</h3>
    <p><strong>Vanity Table:</strong> To the right of the room, near the foot of the bed, place the pink vanity table. Slide the matching pink chair in front of it. Angle the vanity just enough so the tabletop items (like the makeup tray or small mirror) are visible from the front.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Arrange the Sofa and Coffee Table</h3>
    <p><strong>Sofa and Coffee Table:</strong> Place the cream-colored sofa and round pink coffee table in the lower-left corner. Ensure that the sofa faces the television, which will be positioned shortly. Correct alignment is crucial for a balanced room layout.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Install the TV and TV Stand</h3>
    <p><strong>TV Stand:</strong> Position the pale wooden TV stand against the left wall. Place the flat-screen television on top, centering it relative to the sofa. The TV should be directly across from the seating area, creating a cozy entertainment space.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Add Wall Decorations and Plants</h3>
    <p><strong>Wall Decor:</strong> Add decorative touches to the walls:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hang a circular wreath above the TV.</li>
      <li>Place framed art pieces around the window.</li>
      <li>Suspend small potted plants along the upper walls to add greenery and enhance the whimsical atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 10: Place Smaller Items and Final Touches</h3>
    <p><strong>Final Touches:</strong> Add finishing details to complete the room:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Place a pink rug at the center of the floor, near the bed.</li>
      <li>Arrange a pair of fluffy slippers at the foot of the bed.</li>
      <li>Put a small tray with cups or a teapot on the coffee table.</li>
      <li>Add a plush stool or ottoman beside the sofa.</li>
      <li>Ensure any additional plush toys or decorative pillows are scattered neatly around the room.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these final touches is essential to completing Dreamy Room Level 38. Ensure everything is placed exactly as shown in the final image for perfect results.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Check Item Placement:</strong> Double-check each object's placement before confirming. Dreamy Room Level 38 requires perfect positioning, and even small misplacements can prevent completion.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Overlapping Furniture:</strong> Keep small gaps between furniture pieces to avoid overlap, which can cause issues in some versions of the game.</li>
      <li><strong>Save Your Progress:</strong> Save frequently to avoid losing progress if you accidentally misplace an item.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use the Preview:</strong> Some versions of Dreamy Room Level 38 offer a preview of the completed layout. If available, toggle this feature to double-check your progress.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Similar Items:</strong> Group smaller decorative items in your inventory for easier placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Experiment with Angles:</strong> If unsure about an item’s orientation, try rotating it slightly until it matches the final image.</li>
      <li><strong>Take It Slow:</strong> Take your time and avoid rushing. A methodical approach will prevent errors and save you from having to rearrange items.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following these steps, you’ll create the charming pastel bedroom of your dreams in Dreamy Room Level 38. Enjoy the process and take pride in placing each item perfectly!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 39: Winter Shop</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 39! This level is set in a frosty, winter-themed environment, complete with ice-block walls, a wooden roof with a chimney, and a snow-dusted floor. The goal is to place every object in the correct spot to create a bustling mini-shop, with penguin customers and a cozy fountain. Let's dive into the details!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Construct the Ice Walls and Roof</h3>
    <p><strong>Ice Walls and Roof:</strong> Start by placing the ice-block walls on the back and left sides of the room. Then, install the wooden roof with a chimney on top. This structure forms the foundation of your winter-themed shop.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Wooden Door on the Right</h3>
    <p><strong>Door Placement:</strong> Install the sturdy wooden door on the right-hand wall. Ensure the door is slightly toward the front, making the doorway visible in your final arrangement.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Set Up the Vendor’s Counter in the Center</h3>
    <p><strong>Vendor's Counter:</strong> Move to the center of the room and place the vendor's counter or desk. This piece will be the focal point of your shop, where customers will interact with the shopkeeper.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Shopkeeper Behind the Counter</h3>
    <p><strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Place the shopkeeper figure, dressed in a red coat and hat, directly behind the counter. Ensure the shopkeeper is facing forward and ready to greet penguin customers.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Hang the Wall Decorations on the Right</h3>
    <p><strong>Wall Decorations:</strong> Attach the fish-shaped wall decoration above the door. To the left of it, place a small sign or poster to complete the right wall arrangement.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Install the Coat Rack and Hat on the Right Side</h3>
    <p><strong>Coat Rack:</strong> Position the coat rack with a spare hat next to the counter on the right side. This cozy detail enhances the shop's welcoming atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Place the Wooden Shelf Behind the Counter</h3>
    <p><strong>Wooden Shelf:</strong> Place the wooden shelf against the back wall, stacked with green bills. Ensure it’s positioned just above the shopkeeper's eye level to emphasize the shop's success.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Arrange the Wine Rack on the Left Wall</h3>
    <p><strong>Wine Rack:</strong> On the left wall, install the tall wine rack or storage unit. The rack should sit between the ice-block steps and the counter, adding to the shop’s stocked appearance.</p>
