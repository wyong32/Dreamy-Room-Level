    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 95: Mobile Home Transformation</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Dreamy Room Level 91! In this level, you'll turn an empty space into a charming, cozy mobile home. From setting up the veranda to arranging the furniture, follow these steps carefully to create a beautiful and functional space.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Plush Bunny on the Van Roof</h3>
    <p>Begin by dragging the white plush bunny with pink ears and a bow collar onto the purple cushioned bench atop the van's cab. Position the bunny slightly hanging over the front edge for a whimsical effect, and ensure its face faces the open veranda.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Install the Veranda Railing and Arrange Floor Cushions</h3>
    <p>Place the cream-colored railing segments along the open edge of the trailer floor. After securing the railing, position three purple floor cushions with white heart motifs against it. Rotate each cushion slightly for a casual, cozy vibe.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Position the Piano, Sheet Music, Stool, and Bear Plush</h3>
    <p>Place the ivory grand piano with its back panel aligned with the window line. Then, add the sheet music book on the piano's music rest and center the ivory stool in front of it. Complete this musical vignette with the bear plush sitting near the piano as though ready to perform.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Interior Shelf Books and Potted Hydrangea</h3>
    <p>Install a slim wooden shelf under the left-side window and stack three colorful hardcover books in descending height order. Next, place the potted white hydrangea to the right of the books, letting the plant’s leaves graze the window frame.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Build the Bathroom and Laundry Nook</h3>
    <p>Transform the right corner into a laundry-and-bath nook by placing the pastel yellow washing machine under the stairs. Add the purple laundry basket on top. Then, position the striped pastel bathtub in the back wall window corner, and finish with a small wooden side table with a lit candle for coziness.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Assemble the Staircase and Second-Floor Balcony Railing</h3>
    <p>Place the five wooden staircase pieces at the back right corner, leading upward. Once the stairs are in place, snap the cream-colored railing along the second-floor veranda edge, ensuring it aligns neatly with the floor grid.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Furnish the Second Floor Workspace and Bedroom</h3>
    <p>On the upper floor, start by positioning the tall white wardrobe cabinet flush against the back wall. Add two cardboard moving boxes on top for a realistic touch. Then, place the glass candy jar filled with pastel confections on the wardrobe's surface. Hang the pink curtains on the rear windows and add lighting with a yellow wall sconce and purple-based table lamp. Complete the bedroom by adding a yellow bolster on the bed, a floral rug on the floor, and a green potted plant in the corner.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions for Dreamy Room Level 91</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera Adjustment:</strong> Make sure your camera is set to isometric view to align placements properly.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Ensure each railing and furniture piece snaps cleanly to the grid to avoid misalignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Layering:</strong> Be mindful of the staircase and bathtub, as overlapping may cause clipping issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Follow these steps to create a cozy and charming mobile home in Dreamy Room Level 91!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 95: Attic Room Makeover</h2>
    <p>Follow this comprehensive guide to transform the bare canvas of Dreamy Room Level 92 into the charming, fully decorated attic space shown in the completed image. Every placement counts—practice patience and precision to reveal the story hidden in each object.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Glass Railing Panels Along the Balcony Edge</h3>
    <p>Snap the four transparent glass panels into the recessed floor grooves along the balcony’s edge. Make sure they align perfectly with the wooden supports under the skylight windows for a seamless look.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Place the Round Wooden Coffee Table and Decor</h3>
    <p>Center the small round wooden coffee table on the balcony floor. Add two slender green glass bottles, a ceramic cup, and a vintage-style game controller to the table, keeping the spacing even to avoid misplacement errors.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Cream-Colored Armchair</h3>
    <p>Position the plush cream armchair facing the coffee table, angled slightly inward. Adjust its rotation carefully so it doesn’t clip through the railing and rests flush on the floor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Set Up the Shelf Under the Skylight</h3>
    <p>Place the wooden shelving unit under the leftmost skylight. Decorate it with a blue vintage camera, upright smartphone, stacked pastel books, and two small storage boxes underneath—keeping everything neatly within bounds.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Install the Stereo System Under the TV Area</h3>
    <p>Center the stereo receiver under the flat-screen TV area. Flank it with gray speakers placed at equal distance on both sides. Use symmetry to avoid red-highlight misalignments.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Build the Filing Station</h3>
    <p>Place the three-drawer chest left of the desk. Stack two blue and two green file boxes by height. Mount the cork board just above, aligning its edge with the tallest box for a tidy effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Arrange the Desk, Rug, and Chair</h3>
    <p>Drag the white corner desk into the back-right corner under the skylight. Set the ergonomic chair atop the blush-pink circular rug, ensuring the chair base overlaps the rug by at least 80%.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Assemble the Computer Setup</h3>
    <p>Place three monitors in a slight arc across the desk—coded screen left, waveform center, analytics right. Add the black-and-blue PC tower on the left, mount the wall shelf, and place headphones and pastel books on it.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Decorate the Wall and Add Waste Bin</h3>
    <p>Hang the round mirror beneath the vines. Place two posters (“Do It!” and abstract) below it. Set the whiteboard on its stand in the right corner and place the waste bin at its base.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Add Final Floor Accessories</h3>
    <p>Place a leafy potted plant near the desk leg, the record player between the desk and rug, the robotic vacuum near the whiteboard, and the glowing smart speaker beside the rug. Check for overlapping shadows and adjust if needed.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions for Dreamy Room Level 92</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Snap-to Highlights:</strong> Watch for green outlines when placing or rotating objects—these confirm correct positions.</li>
      <li><strong>No Timer Stress:</strong> Dreamy Room Level 92 is untimed, allowing you to refine each detail without rush.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotation Matters:</strong> Items like the armchair and speakers must be angled precisely—small adjustments may be necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Shadow Overlap Warnings:</strong> Red outlines indicate placement issues. Move objects slightly until the highlight turns green.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enjoy your newly decorated attic sanctuary in Dreamy Room Level 92!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 93: Arcade-Themed Room</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 93 features a vibrant arcade-themed setup. Follow this detailed guide to align all elements correctly and complete the level efficiently.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Install the Back Wall’s Shelving and Upper Decorations</h3>
    <p>Begin by placing the large grey two-unit shelf in the back-left corner. Add the red mushroom on the left and pumpkin creature on the right. Mount the oval shelf two tiles to the right and center the pastel fish. Affix the curved neon tube above the shelf line.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Pink Neon Ceiling Accents and Left Wall Decals</h3>
    <p>Install seven pink neon bars across the ceiling borders—four on the back wall and three on the left wall. Place two vertical neon art pieces at the corner, then add the teal cube, pink Tetris Z-piece, tan L-block, and aqua block in geometric alignment.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Arrange the Gaming Rigs on the Left Floor Area</h3>
    <p>Place twin red racing simulators along the left wall, seats and wheels facing center. Add the blue arcade joystick stand beside them, angled inward at 45 degrees.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Set Up the Back-Center Upright Arcade Cabinets</h3>
    <p>Line up two green arcade cabinets at the center back wall, then add the purple one to the right with a small gap. Ensure their base and alignment are symmetrical.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Furnish the Central Gaming Counter and Cozy Decor</h3>
    <p>Place the purple console table in the center, draped with golden lights. Seat the bear behind it holding a controller near the monitor. Add potted plants, a photo frame, and pastel plush charms above the console zone.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Complete the Right Shelf and Arrange Floor Accents</h3>
    <p>Install the tall purple bookshelf to the right wall and fill it with books and storage. Add the teddy bear, clock, spool reel, and box. Place the controller rug, red console unit, and low table with pastries, plant, and crate at the front-right corner.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grid Alignment:</strong> Use highlighted grids for accuracy; half-tile shifts may break layout.</li>
      <li><strong>Order of Placement:</strong> Always start with lights and large objects before smaller items.</li>
      <li><strong>Object Snap Fix:</strong> Remove and replace if alignment seems off.</li>
      <li><strong>Check Perspective:</strong> Use zoom and pan to ensure correct angles for consoles and seats.</li>
      <li><strong>Scene Unlocks:</strong> All objects must be placed to trigger cutscenes.</li>
      <li><strong>Backup:</strong> Take screenshots to retrace steps if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks from Top Player</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tap empty grid tiles to reveal hidden anchors for snapping items.</li>
      <li>Use copy-paste on aligned items like neon bars for consistency.</li>
      <li>Start with large furniture before placing small decor to prevent clutter.</li>
      <li>Rotate items slowly and use helper lines for proper facing.</li>
      <li>Toggle grid view to reset stubborn placements.</li>
      <li>Use undo frequently to quickly fix misalignments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Follow this walkthrough to complete Dreamy Room Level 93 and unlock a dazzling arcade-themed space filled with lights, games, and charm.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 94: Zen Spa Loft</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 94 offers a serene design challenge set in a Zen-inspired loft with spa-like elements. Follow these steps to create a calming and precise environment.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Bamboo Hedge in the Front Left Corner</h3>
    <p>Select the bamboo hedge and place it against the left interior wall, aligned with the red wall corner. Rotate it as needed to avoid overlapping floor stripes and create a natural partition.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Arrange the Tea Table, Teapot Set, and Low Stools</h3>
    <p>Center the wooden tea table on the ground floor near the red folding screen. Add the porcelain teapot and cups on top, and place two circular low stools aligned with the floor stripes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Install the Folding Screen, Bench, and Cushions</h3>
    <p>Place the red folding screen behind the tea table. Add the ornate bench to the right side and place yellow and orange cushions evenly on top. Leave space between the bench and topiary.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Build the Wooden Staircase and Upper-Level Platform</h3>
    <p>Anchor the curved wooden staircase to the back-left corner. Assemble the loft platform above, ensuring no collision with the bamboo hedge.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Furnish the Upper Bedroom and Spa Area</h3>
    <p>Place the canopy bed against the back wall. Add the mattress and pillow, then position the round hot tub to the right side. Decorate the bedside shelf with vases spaced evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Hang Lanterns, Mount the Scroll, and Add Final Decorative Touches</h3>
    <p>Hang lanterns on both eaves, and mount the scroll on the left wall between the bamboo and window. Add flowering shrubs along the railing and orange trees on both floors.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Collision Masks:</strong> Avoid overlapping objects that might lock placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Undo Limit:</strong> Only one undo is allowed—check placements carefully.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Floor Stripes:</strong> Use them like gridlines for alignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Staircase and Bamboo:</strong> Ensure they do not overlap pixels.</li>
      <li><strong>Placement is Key:</strong> Trial-and-error may be needed for perfection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks from Top Player</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Snap to Grid:</strong> Hold Shift while dragging for quicker alignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Pre-Rotate Items:</strong> Save time by rotating items in your inventory view.</li>
      <li><strong>Mirror Placement:</strong> Use axis offset to mirror symmetrical objects like lanterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Objects:</strong> Keep similar items (vases, cushions) together for fast access.</li>
      <li><strong>Preview in Bird’s-Eye Mode:</strong> Catch any misalignments before finalizing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With these tips, you’ll complete Dreamy Room Level 94 with precision and style. Enjoy crafting your peaceful Zen-inspired retreat!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 95: Burger Café Diorama</h2>
    <p>Embark on your journey through Dreamy Room Level 95 with this detailed, step-by-step walkthrough. The true challenge in Dreamy Room Level 95 is determining the exact placement for every object, so follow each instruction carefully to recreate the fully decorated burger café diorama shown in the completed image.</p>

    <h3>Step 1. Place the Base Foundation Block in the Center</h3>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 95, your first objective is to position the L-shaped foundation block that serves as the canvas for all subsequent decorations. Select the large piece with a smooth, light-green tabletop and soft beige sides. Drag it to the center of the empty room grid so that the longer leg points to the right and the shorter leg juts out toward the bottom. Make sure the subtle rounded corners face upward. Once centered perfectly, the green surface should fill most of the middle area, signaling you’re ready for the next step in Dreamy Room Level 94.</p>

    <h3>Step 2. Position the Giant Sesame Burger Roof</h3>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 95, the showpiece of your room is the oversized sesame bun roof. Locate the large, rounded top piece dotted with white sesame seeds. Carefully hover this bun element over the foundation, aligning its flat underside with the left half of the green tabletop. The buns’ gentle gradient from light orange to golden brown must face front. Adjust the rotation until the sesame pattern lines up flush with the underlying platform. Once placed, this burger roof anchors the entire aesthetic of Dreamy Room Level 94.</p>

    <h3>Step 3. Assemble the Burger Building Facade</h3>
    <p>Now in Dreamy Room Level 95, turn your attention to the burger building’s front: a cute café entrance nestled beneath the massive bun roof. Snap the rectangular building block with the orange-framed arched door and two glass windows against the foundation. Next, attach the small blue menu board stand to the right side of the door. Finally, slide the half-cylinder cheese slice and brown patty pieces between the bun and building block, creating a seamless transition. Double-check the alignment for accuracy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4. Add the Fries Station on the Left Platform</h3>
    <p>Transform the left portion of the foundation into a delightful snack station. Assemble the fries container and matching yellow fry sticks, and place them on the small green section jutting out near the front of the foundation. Position the small ice cream cup on the leftmost platform to create visual balance with the fries station. Carefully position the fries container behind the cup so both pieces are fully visible from the front.</p>

    <h3>Step 5. Set the Mini Café Tables and Umbrellas</h3>
    <p>Create outdoor seating by placing two scalloped umbrellas and round tables. First, insert a white-and-blue scalloped umbrella and table into the left mini platform. Then, repeat the process for the right side of the café. Ensure the umbrellas tilt slightly outward and the tables’ legs align with the platform’s support pegs.</p>

    <h3>Step 6. Connect Platforms with the Wooden Bridge</h3>
    <p>Bridge the left and right sections using the wooden croissant-shaped walkway. Align the orange plank piece between the two platforms. Make sure the wood grain faces upward, and the bridge arches just above the fries station. A secure bridge is essential for completing the pathway between your burger house and snack area.</p>

    <h3>Step 7. Install the Decorative Sauce Pipe</h3>
    <p>Add dynamic motion to the scene by positioning the cylindrical sauce pipe. Align the red barrel-like tube with its spout overhanging the green platform. Position the orange liquid piece directly beneath the spout for a natural sauce flow effect. Ensure the spout is aligned straight down to preserve the illusion.</p>

    <h3>Step 8. Place Potted Flowers and Stump Seats</h3>
    <p>Enhance the ambiance with two potted plants and tree-stump stools. Place one pot near the fries station, and the other near the café entrance. Position the tree stump stools beneath the right umbrellas to create a welcoming seating area.</p>

    <h3>Step 9. Final Touches: Frog Figurine and Gold Coin</h3>
    <p>Complete the scene by adding a frog figurine and gold coin. Place the coin on the front-left corner next to the sauce pool, and set the frog on the adjacent orange puddle area. Make sure both are perfectly positioned for the final touch.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Patience Is Key:</strong> Dreamy Room Level 95 rewards meticulous placement. Rushing can lead to misaligned pieces that block later placements.</li>
      <li><strong>Check Connection Points:</strong> Always verify that pegs are fully inserted into slots. Minor gaps can lead to bigger alignment issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotate Before Placing:</strong> Use the rotate tool to preview object orientation before placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Undo and Retry:</strong> Use the undo button if a piece doesn’t fit the first time.</li>
      <li><strong>Zoom In for Detail:</strong> For small accents like the frog or coin, zoom in to ensure pixel-perfect positioning.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>With these tips, you’ll master Dreamy Room Level 95 and create the perfect burger café diorama!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 96: Panda-Themed Haven</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 96 challenges you to transform a corner cutaway into a cozy, three-tiered panda-themed haven. Follow the detailed steps to ensure perfect placement of every object, from furniture to panda figurines, for a harmonious layout.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Lay the Checkered Floor Tile and Erect the Panda-Ear Walls</h3>
    <p>Start by laying the purple-and-cream checkered floor tile in the back-left corner of the top level. Align it carefully, then place the two tall light-gray corner wall panels shaped with panda ears on either side. Ensure the semicircular panda-ear roof outline is centered above the tile.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Install the Floating White Staircase on the Left</h3>
    <p>Next, install the white stone staircase between the top and middle tiers. Ensure the seven steps are placed at a consistent angle and aligned parallel to each other for smooth transition between the levels.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Position the Green Ruffled Bed and Side Table</h3>
    <p>On the top tier, place the green ruffled bed against the right wall, aligning it under the panda-ear roof. Add the dark-wood side table to the left of the bed and place the white porcelain dumpling bowl on it.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Hang the Pendant Lamps and Scroll Painting</h3>
    <p>Hang three yellow pendant lamps above the bed, spaced evenly along the horizontal beam. Add the vertical scroll painting with a crimson frame to the right wall, adjusting its height to align with the bed.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Arrange the Wooden Desk, Computer, and Accent Chair</h3>
    <p>Place the wooden desk flush against the left wall and add a teal monitor with small speakers on either side. Place a pagoda-shaped desk lamp and an orange accent chair in front of the desk.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add the Bookshelf, Decorative Clock, and Scroll Rack</h3>
    <p>Place the arched bookshelf next to the desk and fill it with colorful books and a potted plant. Mount the cuckoo-style clock near the desk and place the scroll rack beside the bookshelf.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Insert the Folding Screen, Wardrobe, and Potted Plant</h3>
    <p>Place the three-panel folding screen at the front edge of the top level. Next, place the panda-face wardrobe on the right wall next to the scroll painting and add the coiled topiary beside it for a final touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Fit the Refrigerator, Sink, Stove, and Kitchen Island</h3>
    <p>On the middle tier, install the refrigerator, sink, and stove in that order. Ensure proper alignment to form a seamless culinary setup, then center the wooden kitchen island in front of the sink.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Add Cookware, Tea Station, and Panda Chef Character</h3>
    <p>Place the green cooking pot on the stove’s front burner and the two-tier tea tray next to the stove. Introduce the panda chef character in the center of the kitchen and ensure it fits without clipping.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Decorate the Ground Veranda with Pond, Pandas, and Seating</h3>
    <p>On the ground level, start by placing the stone water basin and plant rack. Then arrange the ceramic jars, panda cub figurines, and seating elements like the wooden swing bench and rocking chairs to complete the outdoor charm.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Patience with Placement:</strong> Exact grid alignment is essential. Zoom in for precise adjustments.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer Awareness:</strong> Always ensure you're placing items on the correct tier to avoid blocking the staircase.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotation Sensitivity:</strong> Use the rotation tool carefully for curved or angled items to prevent clipping.</li>
      <li><strong>Undo & Reset:</strong> Reset individual objects instead of the whole room if you need to make corrections.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following this walkthrough, you'll successfully create a panda-themed paradise in Dreamy Room Level 96. Take your time to adjust every element to perfection and enjoy the process of creating your cozy haven!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 97: Pig-Themed Bedroom</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 97 invites you to design a serene and nostalgic room with a pig-themed bedroom at its heart. Follow this walkthrough to recreate the room exactly as shown in the finished layout.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Position the Bed in the Right Corner</h3>
    <p>Place the green bed in the back-right corner of the room. The headboard should sit just below the window, aligned with the angled wall.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Window with Green Curtains</h3>
    <p>Mount the window directly above the bed. Ensure the green curtains are evenly placed and centered to frame the bed nicely.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Arrange the Closet and Top Compartment</h3>
    <p>Place the tall wooden closet next to the bed’s right side. On top of it, stack the storage compartment. Both must be aligned neatly for the layout to register as correct.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Place the Desk and Chair</h3>
    <p>Move to the left side and position the desk facing the bed. Slide the chair under the desk, leaving enough walkway space between the bed and desk.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Shelf, Books, and Pig Figurine</h3>
    <p>Above the desk, attach the small wall shelf. Place three books (in different heights) and a pig figurine to the left of them to keep the pig theme going.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Install the Air Conditioner and Wall Clock</h3>
    <p>Mount the air conditioner high on the left wall. Then add the round wall clock near the center top, just above the shelf.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Set Up the Nightstand, Lamp, and Digital Clock</h3>
    <p>Place the nightstand to the bed’s left side. Put the lamp and digital clock (showing 20:34) on top, facing forward for visibility.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Arrange the Pig Plushies</h3>
    <p>Place the larger pig plush in the center of the bed and stack the smaller one behind it. These plushies are key to the level’s theme.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Decorate the Floor and Add the Telescope</h3>
    <p>Lay the pig-shaped slipper rug beside the bed. Place the telescope near the bottom-left corner, angled outward as if pointed to the sky.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Position the Mirror, Record Player, and Mini Garden</h3>
    <p>Set the tall mirror near the closet. Next to it, add the small round table with the record player. Near the bottom edge of the room, place the mini garden with a potted plant and a pastry on display.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Object Locking:</strong> Some items snap into place and can be difficult to move afterward—check placement carefully first.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Overlaps:</strong> Ensure objects do not block each other to prevent misalignment errors.</li>
      <li><strong>Color Coordination:</strong> The green and pink color palette is intentional—maintain balance for proper theme alignment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use Preview Mode:</strong> This helps you verify item alignment before finalizing.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotate When Needed:</strong> Some furniture can be rotated—experiment to find the best fit.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Thematic Items:</strong> Keep pig-themed items close together for a cohesive look.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following this guide, you’ll recreate the perfect pig-themed bedroom and complete Dreamy Room Level 97 with ease. Take your time, enjoy the decorating process, and watch your cozy space come to life!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 98: Dairy Factory</h2>
    <p>In Dreamy Room Level 98, you’ll design a vibrant dairy factory with precise object placement. From cows to production lines, follow this guide for the perfect factory setup.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the White Wooden Fence and Hay Bales</h3>
    <p>Start by placing the white wooden fence against the left wall on the raised floor platform. Rotate the fence and line up three hay bales in front of it, ensuring they are flush with the fence.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Position the Three Farm Cows</h3>
    <p>Place the cows in front of the hay bales, ensuring they’re aligned against the fence. Check for proper spacing and alignment using the grid toggle.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Arrange the Wooden Crates and Metal Milk Canisters</h3>
    <p>Fill the front platform with wooden crates and milk canisters, avoiding overlap with the cow feeding area. Ensure the crates and canisters are well-balanced in size and height.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Install the Conveyor Belt and Stack the Cardboard Boxes</h3>
    <p>Align the conveyor belt along the platform’s front edge, making sure it runs parallel to the crates and milk canisters. Place cardboard boxes along the conveyor at equal intervals.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Metal Staircase, Potted Plant, Elevated Walkway, and Bunny Workers</h3>
    <p>Place the metal staircase at the left edge of the raised platform, leading to the elevated walkway. Add bunny workers along the walkway as they manage the production line.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Place Milk Bottles, Glass Jars, and Central Control Station Items</h3>
    <p>Arrange milk bottles along the conveyor belt and glass jars on the central hexagonal platform. Place the instruction book on the control station for an authentic touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Install the Back-Wall Machinery</h3>
    <p>Install the large vat, silos, and mixing unit along the back wall. Carefully align the machinery and connect them using the appropriate pipes and vents.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Position the Milk Truck, Vending Machines, and Decorative Sign</h3>
    <p>Finish by positioning the milk truck at the lower right edge, place the vending machines near the conveyor belt, and mount the cow face wall sign on the left wall.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Pay attention to grid alignment and avoid overlaps as they can affect object placement.</li>
      <li><strong>Elevation:</strong> The elevation differences between platforms require careful stacking, particularly when layering items.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> Be mindful of rotation angles, especially for the decorative items like the vending machines and sign.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use Grid Toggle:</strong> This helps ensure all items align correctly with each other and the platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Preview Mode:</strong> Check your work before finalizing to avoid misalignments.</li>
      <li><strong>Undo Button:</strong> If you make a mistake, use the undo button to correct it before proceeding.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following this guide, you'll successfully complete Dreamy Room Level 98 and set up a fully functional dairy factory. Enjoy the decorating process!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 99: Seaside Sushi Bar</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 99 invites you to create a serene seaside sushi bar on a floating wooden platform. Follow this step-by-step guide to arrange the items with precision and build the perfect coastal retreat.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Floating Wooden Platform in the Center</h3>
    <p>Begin by positioning the floating wooden platform in the center of the room. Ensure the longer edge aligns with the bottom wall, and the shorter edge sits against the right-hand wall.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Place the Sushi Bar Building with Blue-Tiled Roof</h3>
    <p>Position the sushi bar building with the blue-tiled roof in the back-left corner. Align the left side against the wall and the back flush with the right wall. The roof’s peak should sit about one inch below the top edge of the walls.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Place the Airplane-Shaped Fish Tank on the Roof Ridge</h3>
    <p>Place the whimsical airplane-shaped fish tank atop the sushi bar’s roof, two-thirds of the way toward the back corner. Fill it with tropical fish and coral.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Position the Transparent Fish Display Tank on the Right Side of the Counter</h3>
    <p>Position the transparent fish display tank on the right side of the sushi bar counter, ensuring it aligns flush with the counter’s lip without obstructing the sashimi prep area.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Seating Benches, Stools, and Life Ring Cushions</h3>
    <p>Place the wooden benches in front of the sushi bar counter. Add the small backless stools and life ring cushions for a coastal touch, ensuring they are evenly spaced along the front and opposite sides.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Hang Lantern Lights and Arrange Seaweed and Shell Decorations</h3>
    <p>Hang soft purple lanterns along the roof’s overhang. Arrange clusters of green seaweed and decorative shells on the roof and walls for a complete seaside ambiance.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Add the Cat Chef Signpost and Rowboat</h3>
    <p>Place the whimsical cat chef signpost at the front-left corner of the platform. Then, position the small wooden rowboat near the platform’s left edge with the oars angled inside.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Position the Fish Drying Rack, Fishing Net, Bucket, and Rod</h3>
    <p>Arrange the fish drying rack, fishing net, metal bucket, and fishing rod along the right side of the platform to complete the fishing area and enhance the coastal theme.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Decorate the Counter with Sushi Plates and Ingredient Baskets</h3>
    <p>Arrange assorted sushi plates across the counter. Place ingredient baskets filled with vegetables and condiment bottles to add detail and realism to the sushi bar.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Place Cat Characters Around the Sushi Bar</h3>
    <p>Populate the scene with cat characters: position a fishing cat near the net, sushi server cats behind the counter, a seated cat on the left bench, and a standing cat in the center.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Pay close attention to grid alignment to prevent misplacement of objects.</li>
      <li><strong>Object Overlaps:</strong> Ensure that objects do not clip into each other, especially with the hanging lanterns and fish tanks.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear View:</strong> Double-check that interactive elements, like the fish tanks, maintain visibility without obstruction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use the Grid-Snapping Feature:</strong> Hold Shift while dragging to align items precisely along the grid.</li>
      <li><strong>Preview Mode:</strong> Rotate the camera to inspect for hidden clipping issues or misalignments.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-Select Tool:</strong> Group smaller objects together to streamline the placement process on the counter.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following this guide, you’ll create a perfect seaside sushi bar and complete Dreamy Room Level 99 with ease. Enjoy the process and the serene atmosphere you’ll build!</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step guide for Dreamy Room Level 100: Toy-Filled Haven</h2>
    <p>Dreamy Room Level 100 invites you to transform a pastel corner into a cozy, toy-filled haven. Follow this step-by-step guide to ensure every item is placed just right for a whimsical final look.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Place the Curtains and Sky Decals on the Window Wall</h3>
    <p>Start by hanging the floor-length pink gradient curtains on the left wall, centered and three floor tiles above the wooden platform. Add the smiling sun decal above the curtains, and surround it with fluffy cloud decals to create a whimsical sky.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Arrange the Windowsill Decorations</h3>
    <p>On the windowsill, place the terracotta pot with a green succulent on the left edge. Add the lavender flower-shaped cushion on the right, placing the grey cat figurine in the center, facing the curtain.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Set Up the Cabinet Under the Window</h3>
    <p>Place the blue-front cabinet under the window. Decorate its top with a stack of pastel towels, a pair of baby bottles, and a tissue box. Align everything precisely to ensure a neat and balanced look.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Mount the Right-Wall Corner Shelf and Decals</h3>
    <p>Install the two-tier wooden corner shelf on the right wall, with a pink bunny plush on top and a blue toy car on the lower tier. Above it, hang a shelf with three pastel books and a snowman plush. Add a floral drawing to the wall for a personal touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Apply the Dinosaur Decal and Hang the Map</h3>
    <p>On the right wall, place a green dinosaur decal at knee height, with its head pointing towards the center of the room. Then, hang the framed world map above the dinosaur, three tiles from the ceiling.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Install the Wardrobe and Stack the Top Accessories</h3>
    <p>Place the pastel wardrobe in the back right corner. On top, arrange the pastel storage tins, followed by a pink and yellow lunchbox. Align everything to ensure the perfect fit.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Position the Pink Slide Ramp and Two Plush Toys</h3>
    <p>Place the pink slide ramp in the left foreground, angled inward. At the top of the ramp, position the pink llama plush, and place the green alpaca rocker at the bottom, facing the center of the room.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Lay Out the Train Track and Cat Plush</h3>
    <p>In the center-left area, arrange the grey train tracks in a rectangle shape. Place the pastel train engine on the tracks and position the blue cat plush beside it, slightly overlapping the track's edge.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Add the Bear Plush with Balloons and the Carrot Plush</h3>
    <p>Place the brown bear plush in the center of the room, with heart-patterned balloons in its paws. Add the small orange carrot plush in front of the bear, angled toward its belly.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Arrange the Puzzle Bench, Blocks, Horse Box, and Ball</h3>
    <p>Place the grey puzzle piece bench in the right foreground. On top, stack the cube blocks, and add the orange basketball in front. Finally, position the small cardboard box with the pink horse plush and yarn ball beside the bench.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precision Placement:</strong> Make sure each item is aligned correctly to avoid errors.</li>
